<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div id="section-welcome" class="section level3">
<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>In previous lessons, you learned how to fit linear regression models
using the method of least squares. You can now create models that
predict a response variable based on an explanatory variable, and you
understand how the regression line minimizes the sum of squared
residuals.</p>
<p>But knowing <em>how</em> to fit a model is only part of the story.
When using statistical models, you also need to know <strong>how
well</strong> your model performs. Does it make accurate predictions?
How much of the variability in your data does it explain? Are there
unusual observations that might be affecting your results?</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to answer these critical questions
by assessing and interpreting the quality of your regression models.</p>

<h2>Assessing model fit</h2>
<div id="section-how-well-does-our-textbook-model-fit"
class="section level3">
<h3>How well does our textbook model fit?</h3>
<p>Now that we understand what linear regression models <em>are</em> and
how they <em>work</em>, a natural next question is to consider <em>how
well</em> they work. In an intuitive sense, it seems clear that the
regression line for the textbooks fits really well.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = textbooks, aes(x = amaz_new, y = ucla_new)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-model-fit-simple_files/figure-html/textbooks-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-how-well-does-our-possum-model-fit"
class="section level3">
<h3>How well does our possum model fit?</h3>
<p>At the same time, the regression line for the possums fits less well,
but it still seems useful.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_l)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-model-fit-simple_files/figure-html/possum-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Can we quantify our intuition about the quality of the model fit?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-sums-of-squared-deviations" class="section level3">
<h3>Sums of squared deviations</h3>
<p>In fact we can. Recall that we initially considered any number of
lines. We settled on the unique regression line by applying the least
squares criterion. That is, we found the line that minimizes the sum of
the squared residuals. For each observation–which is represented on the
scatterplot by a point–the residual is simply the vertical distance
between that point and the line.</p>
<p><img src="ims-model-fit-simple_files/figure-html/possum_augment_total_tail-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Here, we have highlighted the possum residuals with gray arrows. If
we could find a line that made those gray arrows shorter –collectively,
and after squaring them–that would be our regression line; but there is
no such line: this one is the best.</p>
<p>Note that we can’t just minimize the sum of the residuals. That
number is always zero, since the positive and negative residuals cancel
each other out when added together.</p>
<p>The sum of the squares works well mathematically, but it also has the
effect of penalizing large residuals disproportionately. This is
generally considered a useful property for statistical modeling, since
you would usually prefer a model that misses often by a little bit, but
never by a lot; to a model that works well most of the time but
occasionally is way off. Once again, there are situations when other
criteria are used for fitting models, but we won’t talk about them in
this tutorial.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-measures-of-model-fit" class="section level2">
<h2>Measures of model fit</h2>
<p>One way to assess strength of fit is to consider how far off the
model is for a typical case. That is, for some observations, the fitted
value will be very close to the actual value, while for others it will
not. The magnitude of a typical residual can give us a sense of
generally how close our estimates are.</p>
<div id="section-sse" class="section level3">
<h3>SSE</h3>
<p>Recall that some of the residuals are positive, while others are
negative. In fact, it is guaranteed by the least squares fitting
procedure that the mean of the residuals is zero. Thus, it makes more
sense to compute the square of the residuals.</p>
<p>After using the <code>augment()</code> function to tidy up our model,
the sum of the squared residuals is easily computed using
<code>summarize()</code>. By convention, we often call this quantity
<strong>SSE</strong>, for <em>s</em>um of <em>s</em>quared
<em>e</em>rrors. It can also be computed as the variance of the
residuals times one fewer than the number of observations.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the column of the <code>augment()</code>-ed model we are
interested in is named <code>.resid</code>. The period before it is part
of its name and must be included!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>total_tail_mod |&gt;
  augment() |&gt;
  summarize(SSE = sum(.resid^2),
            SSE_also = (n() - 1) * var(.resid))</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">

  </script>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-rmse" class="section level3">
<h3>RMSE</h3>
<p>The SSE is a single number that captures how much our model missed
by. Unfortunately, it is hard to interpret, since the units have been
squared. Thus, another common way of thinking about the accuracy of a
model is the <strong>root mean squared error</strong> or
<strong>RMSE</strong>.</p>
<p>The RMSE is essentially the standard deviation of the residuals. You
might expect us to divide by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
here, but we instead divide by the number of <em>degrees of
freedom</em>, which in this case is <span
class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span>. The concept of degrees of freedom
comes up in many contexts in statistics, but a fuller discussion is
beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    RMSE = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_i{e_i^2}}{d.f.} } = \sqrt{ \frac{SSE}{n-2}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>The RMSE also generalizes to any kind of model for a single numerical
response, so it is not specific to regression models.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-residual-standard-error-possums"
class="section level3">
<h3>Residual standard error (possums)</h3>
<p>When R displays the <code>summary()</code> of a regression model, it
displays the “residual standard error”. This is the RMSE. Conveniently,
the RMSE is in the units of the response, so this says that our model
makes a predicted body length that is typically within about 3.57
centimeters of the truth. That seems useful, since the possums in our
data set are between 75 and 96 centimeters.</p>

<h2>Comparing model fits</h2>

class="section level3">
<h3>How well does our textbook model fit?</h3>
<p>Previously, you learned about how we could use the sum of the squared
residuals to quantify how well our model fit the data. However, we noted
that although the textbook model seemed to fit the data really well, the
residual standard error was more than $10.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-how-well-does-our-possum-model-fit-1"
class="section level3">
<h3>How well does our possum model fit?</h3>
<p>On the other hand, the residual standard error for the possum model
was about 3.5 cm, which seems like a high degree of accuracy, for a
model that does not seem to be as tight of a fit.</p>
<p><img src="ims-model-fit-simple_files/figure-html/possum-plot-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-null-average-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Null (average) model</h3>
<p>It’s hard to compare $10 to 3.5 centimeters. Which is “bigger”? What
would be nice is if we had a way to compare the quality of a model’s fit
that was unitless. To do so, it is helpful to think about a
benchmark.</p>
<p>If you had to predict the body length of a possum, and you didn’t
have any information about that particular possum, what would your
prediction be? Let’s pause for a second and think.</p>
<p>A sensible choice would be the average length of all possum. And in
fact, if you have to make the same prediction for every possum, the
average is the <em>best</em> number you can pick. We can think about
this as a model where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> (the
predicted value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) is equal to
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> (the average value of <span

</div>
<div id="section-visualization-of-null-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualization of null model</h3>
<p>This model is often called the <strong>null model</strong>. This

<h3>SSE of the null model</h3>

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-coefficient-of-determination" class="section level3">
<h3>Coefficient of determination</h3>
<p>The ratio of the SSE for our model to the SSE for the null model is a
quantification of the variability explained by our model. More
specifically, the SSE for the null model is often called SST, for the
<em>total</em> sum of the squares. This is a measure of the variability
in the response variable.</p>
<p>By building a regression model, we hope to explain some of that
variability. The portion of the SST that is <em>not</em> explained by
our model is the SSE. These ideas are captured by this formula for the
“coefficient of determination,” usually referred to as <span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \frac{Var(e)}{Var(y)} \,,
\]</span></p>
<p>Due to this definition, we interpret <span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> as the proportion of the variability
in the response variable that is explained by our model. It is the most
commonly cited measure of the quality of the fit of a regression
model.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-connection-to-correlation" class="section level3">
<h3>Connection to correlation</h3>
<p>We have already seen a connection between the value of the
correlation between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and the slope of the regression line.
In fact, the value of the correlation coefficient is also closely
related to the value of <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. For
least squares regression models with a single explanatory variable, the
value of <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is just the square of
the correlation coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(r_{x,
y}^2\)</span>).</p>
<p>Why then, do we need both concepts? Correlation is strictly a
bivariate quantity, it can only be between a single response and a
single explanatory variable. However, regression is a much more flexible
modeling framework. Each regression model has its own value of <span
class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>, but in future lessons you will learn
how such models can incorporate many explanatory variables, unlike
correlation.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> gives us a numerical
measurement of the strength of fit of our linear regression relative to
a null model based on the average of the response variable (<span
class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_{null} = \bar{y}\)</span>).</p>
<p>The null model has an <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> of
zero because <span class="math inline">\(SSE = SST\)</span>. That is,
since the fitted values (<span
class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_{null}\)</span>) are all equal to the
average (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>), the residual for
each observation is the distance between that observation and the mean
of the response. Since we can always fit the null model, it serves as a
baseline against which all other models will be compared.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The easiest way to see the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>
value is to apply the <code>summary()</code> function to your model
object. In this case, we see that our model based on tail length
explains about 32% of the variability in body length for these
possums.</p>

statistical modeling. A high <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>

<h2>Unusual points</h2>
<p>In our previous discussion of outliers, we learned how to identify
points that seem to be unusual. Now, we will refine that understanding
by introducing two related but distinct concepts: leverage and
influence.</p>
<p>Recall the data we examined previously about Major League Baseball
players during the 2010 season. We considered the relationship between
the number of home runs hit by each player, and the corresponding number
of bases that each player stole. The first statistic is a measurement of
power, while the latter is a measurement of speed. As these skills are
considered complementary, it should not be surprising that a simple
linear regression model has a negative slope. In this case, we have fit
the model to only those players with at least 400 at-bats, in a simple
attempt to control for the confounding influence of playing time.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>regulars &lt;- mlbbat10 |&gt;
  filter(at_bat &gt; 400)

ggplot(data = regulars, aes(x = stolen_base, y = home_run)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = 0)</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-model-fit-simple_files/figure-html/up2-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We noted previously that there were two potential outliers here: the
point corresponding to the slugger Jose Bautista in the upper left, and
the point belonging to speedster Juan Pierre in the lower right.</p>
<p>Now that we have a regression model, we want to think about how
individual observations might affect the slope of the line. Typically,
the purpose of interpreting the slope coefficient is to learn about the
overall relationship between the two variables, so it doesn’t
necessarily make sense if one or two individual observations have a
disproportionate effect on that slope. Unfortunately, such points of
high <em>leverage</em> are quite common.</p>
<div id="section-leverage" class="section level3">
<h3>Leverage</h3>
<p>Leverage has a precise mathematical definition that you can see here.
The specifics of the formula are not so important, but you should
recognize that the leverage score <span
class="math inline">\(h_i\)</span> for an observation is entirely a
function of the distance between each <strong>individual</strong> value
of the explanatory variable and <strong>mean</strong> of the explanatory
variable. This means that points that are close to the center of the
scatterplot (along the x-axis) have low leverage, while points that are
far from the (horizontal) center of the scatterplot have high leverage.
For leverage, the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinate
doesn’t matter at all.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  h_i = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i -
\bar{x})^2}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="section-leverage-computations" class="section level3">
<h3>Leverage computations</h3>
<p>It should not be surprising then, that the player with the largest
leverage value is the aforementioned Juan Pierre (in the lower
right-hand corner of the plot). The leverage scores can be retrieved
using the <code>augment()</code> function, and then examining the
<code>.hat</code> variable. [The name comes from the historical
convention of computing leverage from the “hat” matrix.] Note that the
leverage scores depend only on stolen bases. In this case, Pierre’s
leverage score is nearly twice as large as that of the next player.</p>
<p>The <code>slice_max()</code> allows for you to <strong>both</strong>
order a dataframe and select how many entries you wish to keep. The
<code>order_by</code> argument allows for you to specify what variable
to order by (similar to <code>arrange()</code>), and the <code>n</code>
argument allows for you to specify how many rows you wish to keep.
Pretty neat!</p>

</div>
<p>Observations of high leverage, by virtue of their extreme values of
the explanatory variable, may or may not have a considerable effect on
the slope of the regression line. An observation that does have such an
effect is called “influential.” In our case, the regression line is very
close to the point corresponding to Juan Pierre. So, even though this is
a high leverage observation, it is not considered influential.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-consider-rickey-henderson" class="section level3">
<h3>Consider Rickey Henderson…</h3>
<p>However, suppose that there was a player with a similar number of
stolen bases, but a decent number of home runs as well. In fact, Hall of
Famer Rickey Henderson was such a player, and in his MVP-winning season
of 1990, he stole 65 bases while hitting 28 home runs. Let’s add this
observation to our plot.</p>
<p><img src="ims-model-fit-simple_files/figure-html/up4-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The original regression line is plotted as the dashed black line, and
the new regression line (with Rickey Henderson) is plotted as a solid
blue line. Notice how the new regression line pulls upward ever so
slightly from the previous dotted regression line. This is a direct
result of Henderson’s influence.</p>
<p>Because this is a point of high leverage, it has the ability to pull
the slope of the regression line up. However, unlike the point
corresponding to Pierre, the point corresponding to Henderson also has a
large residual. The combination of high leverage and large residual
determine influence.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-influence-via-cooks-distance" class="section level3">
<h3>Influence via Cook’s distance</h3>
<p>In fact, a measurement known as Cook’s distance combines these two
quantities (leverage and residual) to measure influence. These figures
are also reported by the <code>augment()</code> function. We note here
that the observation corresponding to Henderson has a large residual,
high leverage, and by far the largest value of Cook’s distance.</p>

<li><strong>Does removing it fundamentally change your research

<p>The <em>leverage</em> of an observation in a regression model is
defined entirely in terms of the distance of that observation from the
mean of the explanatory variable. That is, observations close to the
mean of the explanatory variable have low leverage, while observations
far from the mean of the explanatory variable have high leverage. Points
of high leverage may or may not be influential.</p>
<p>The <code>augment()</code> function from the <strong>broom</strong>

<h2>Dealing with outliers</h2>
<p>Previously, we learned about how leverage and influence can help us
understand how outliers affect our regression model. Suppose you have
determined that an influential observation is affecting the slope of
your regression line in a way that undermines the scientific merit of
your model. What can you do about it?</p>
<p><img src="ims-model-fit-simple_files/figure-html/o2-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The short answer is that there isn’t much you can do about it other
than removing the outliers. As the statistical modeller, this is a
decision you can make, but it’s crucial that you understand the
ramifications of this decision and act in good scientific faith.</p>
<div id="section-the-full-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The full model</h3>
<p>In the full model of all the regular players from 2010 and Rickey
Henderson from 1990, the slope of the regression line was -0.21 home
runs per stolen base. In other words, players who steal five extra bases
hit about one fewer home run, on average.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lm(home_run ~ stolen_base, data = regulars_plus) |&gt;
  coef()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## (Intercept) stolen_base 
##  19.3282493  -0.2085899</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-removing-outliers-that-dont-fit"
class="section level3">
<h3>Removing outliers that don’t fit</h3>
<p>Now, in this case, there is an easy argument that Rickey Henderson
does not fit with the rest of these data. It is a bit of a contrived
argument, since we added him previously for effect, but nonetheless
there are good reasons to assert that Henderson doesn’t belong. If we
remove him, note how the slope of the regression line decreases. Now,
it’s only four extra stolen bases that are associated with hitting one
fewer home run.</p>
<pre><code>## (Intercept) stolen_base 
##  19.7168513  -0.2549133</code></pre>
<p>Remember that when removing outliers, the first questions you should
ask yourself are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the justification for removing the observation?</li>
<li>How does the scope of inference change?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anytime you are thinking about removing outliers, you should ask
yourself what the justification is. “Because it improves my results” is
not a good justification. Indeed, conscious ignorance of valid data is
not intellectually honest, and has been the cause of more than a few
retractions of previously published scientific papers. Be skeptical. The
burden of proof is on you to make a strong argument as to why data
should be omitted.</p>
<p>Second, you must consider how this changes the scope of inference. If
you are studying countries, are you omitting only the poorest countries?
If so, then your results no longer apply to all countries, just non-poor
countries. Misunderstanding how the scope of inference changes can be a
fatal flaw in your analysis.</p>

<p>With Henderson out of the way, we could consider removing Juan Pierre
as well. Here, there really aren’t any good arguments as to why this
should be done. First, the point is not influential, so whether we
include it or not, it won’t affect our results much. More importantly,
because Juan Pierre was just a regular major league player in 2010,
there is no reason to think that he somehow doesn’t belong to the larger
group of players. What is so special about Juan Pierre that would lead
us to exclude him? If, hypothetically, he was a pitcher, or he was 60
years old, or he only had one arm, then you could try and make that
case. But there is nothing like that going on here, and so we have no
scientific reason to exclude him.</p>
<p>Again, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the justification for removing the observation?</li>
<li>How does the scope of inference change?</li>
</ul>

<p>Now it’s time to deal with some outliers on your own.</p>

<h2>Your turn!</h2>
<p>Observations can be outliers for a number of different reasons.
Statisticians must always be careful—and more importantly,
transparent—when dealing with outliers. Sometimes, a better model fit
can be achieved by simply removing outliers and re-fitting the model.
However, one must have strong justification for doing this. A desire to
have a higher <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is not a good
enough reason!</p>
<p>In the <code>mlbbat10</code> data, the outlier with an
<code>obp</code> of 0.550 is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Scales">Bobby Scales</a>, an
infielder who had four hits in 13 <code>at_bat</code>s for the Chicago
Cubs. Scales also walked seven times, resulting in his unusually high
<code>obp</code>. The justification for removing Scales here is weak.
While his performance was unusual, there is nothing to suggest that it
is not a valid data point, nor is there a good reason to think that
somehow we will learn more about Major League Baseball players by
excluding him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can demonstrate how removing him will affect our
model.</p>
