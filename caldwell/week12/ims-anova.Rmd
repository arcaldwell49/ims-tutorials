## Welcome

### Introduction

Welcome to this interactive tutorial on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to compare means across multiple groups simultaneously---a powerful extension of the two-sample t-test you've learned previously.

We'll work with real data from the General Social Survey to investigate an interesting question: Is there a relationship between vocabulary scores and self-identified social class?

Throughout this tutorial, you'll not only learn the mechanics of ANOVA but also understand *why* we need this method and how to properly interpret and communicate results.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. **Conduct exploratory data analysis** for comparing a numerical variable across multiple groups using appropriate visualizations
2. **State hypotheses** for an ANOVA test in both words and mathematical notation
3. **Check conditions** for ANOVA, including independence, normality, and equal variance
4. **Perform an ANOVA** to test whether means differ across groups and interpret the F-statistic
5. **Interpret ANOVA results**, including understanding degrees of freedom, sum of squares, and p-values
6. **Explain the multiple comparisons problem** and why adjustments are necessary when conducting pairwise tests
7. **Conduct post-hoc pairwise comparisons** using modern methods including Bonferroni, Holm, FDR (False Discovery Rate), and Tukey HSD adjustments
8. **Use the `emmeans` package** for estimating and comparing marginal means in a principled way

## Introduction to the Data

### Research Question

**Does vocabulary score vary by social class?** 

This is an example of a question where we need to compare means across **more than two** groups. A t-test won't work here because:

- A t-test can only compare **two** groups at a time
- Doing multiple t-tests (lower vs. working, lower vs. middle, etc.) creates statistical problems we'll discuss later
- We need a method that can test all groups **simultaneously**

Enter ANOVA: **AN**alysis **O**f **VA**riance.

### The Dataset: General Social Survey

Our data comes from the **General Social Survey (GSS)**, a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States conducted since 1972. The GSS tracks social trends and attitudes over time.

For this analysis, we'll focus on two variables:

> - `wordsum`: Score on a 10-question vocabulary test (scores range from 0 to 10)
> - `class`: Self-identified social class with 4 levels (lower, working, middle, upper)

Here's a glimpse of our data:

|   | `wordsum`|`class` |
|:--|:---------|:-------|
|1  |         6|MIDDLE  |
|2  |         9|WORKING |
|3  |         6|WORKING |
|4  |         5|WORKING |
|5  |         6|WORKING |
|6  |         6|WORKING |
|...|       ...|...     |
|795|         9|MIDDLE  |

We have 795 respondents who answered both the vocabulary questions and the social class question.

### The Vocabulary Test: `wordsum`

Respondents are given a list of words and asked to choose which word comes closest to the meaning of a word provided in capital letters. Here are the 10 questions:

> 1. SPACE (school, noon, captain, room, board, don't know)
> 2. BROADEN (efface, make level, elapse, embroider, widen, don't know)
> 3. EMANATE (populate, free, prominent, rival, come, don't know)
> 4. EDIBLE (auspicious, eligible, fit to eat, sagacious, able to speak, don't know)
> 5. ANIMOSITY (hatred, animation, disobedience, diversity, friendship, don't know)
> 6. PACT (puissance, remonstrance, agreement, skillet, pressure, don't know)
> 7. **CLOISTERED (miniature, bunched, arched, malady, secluded, don't know)**
> 8. CAPRICE (value, a star, grimace, whim, inducement, don't know)
> 9. ACCUSTOM (disappoint, customary, encounter, get used to, business, don't know)
> 10. ALLUSION (reference, dream, eulogy, illusion, aria, don't know)

**Try one!** For example, is CLOISTERED closest in meaning to miniature, bunched, arched, malady, or secluded?

(The correct answer is **secluded**---cloistered means isolated or shut away from the world, often in a religious context.)

**Why vocabulary scores?** Vocabulary tests are commonly used as proxy measures for educational attainment and verbal cognitive ability. The GSS uses this 10-word test to measure respondents' verbal skills in a quick, standardized way.

### Distribution of Vocabulary Score

Let's start by looking at the overall distribution of vocabulary scores, ignoring social class for now:

```{r echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = gss, aes(x = wordsum)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

The distribution of vocabulary scores is roughly symmetric and centered around 6. Scores range from 0 to 10, though very low and very high scores are uncommon. There's a slight left skew, but nothing dramatic. Most people score between 4 and 8 on this test.

### Self-Identified Social Class: `class`

Respondents were asked: 

*"If you were asked to use one of four names for your social class, which would you say you belong in: the lower class, the working class, the middle class, or the upper class?"*

Let's see how many people selected each category:
 
```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = gss, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
```

The majority of respondents identify as working class or middle class. Relatively few identify as lower or upper class. This distribution reflects common patterns in American self-identification---most people place themselves in the "middle" categories.

### Making the Connection

These visualizations tell us about each variable individually, but they don't reveal whether there's a **relationship** between them. 

**The key question:** Do vocabulary scores differ systematically across social class groups? Or is any variation we see just random noise?

To answer this, we need to:

1. Visualize the relationship (next section!)
2. Formalize our question as statistical hypotheses
3. Check whether our data meet the conditions for ANOVA
4. Conduct the analysis and interpret results

Time to dig in!

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### EDA: A Critical First Step

Before jumping into any statistical test, we should **always visualize the data first**. Visualization helps us:

- Understand the relationship between variables
- Check whether ANOVA assumptions might be reasonably met
- Develop intuition about what the statistical analysis might reveal
- Identify potential outliers or unusual patterns

**Remember:** Statistical tests give us precise p-values, but visualizations give us understanding. Both are essential!

### Your Task: Visualizing the Relationship

Now it's your turn to explore the data! 

Create visualizations to compare vocabulary scores across social class groups.

**Your task:** 

- Using the `gss` dataset, create a histogram of vocabulary scores (`wordsum`)
- Use an appropriate binwidth (remember: scores are whole numbers from 0-10)
- Facet the histogram by social class level (`class`)

**After creating the plot, carefully compare the distributions.** Look at:

- **Shape:** Are the distributions roughly symmetric? Skewed?
- **Center:** Do the groups appear to have different average scores?
- **Spread:** Is the variability similar across groups?
- **Unusual observations:** Are there outliers in any group?

```{r vocabulary, exercise=TRUE}
# Using gss, plot wordsum
ggplot(data = ___, mapping = aes(___)) +
  # Add a histogram layer with appropriate binwidth
  ___ +
  # Facet by class
  facet_wrap(~___)
```

```{r vocabulary-hint}
# Hints:
# - Use `gss` as the plot's `data` argument
# - Map `x` to `wordsum` in `aes()`
# - Add a histogram layer with `geom_histogram()`
# - Vocabulary scores are whole numbers, so binwidth = 1 makes sense
# - The faceting formula is specified as `~class`
```

```{r vocabulary-solution}
# Using gss, plot wordsum
ggplot(data = gss, mapping = aes(x = wordsum)) +
  # Add a histogram layer
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  # Facet by class
  facet_wrap(~class)
```

### What Do You Notice?

Great work! Before you move on, take a moment to carefully examine all aspects of these distributions:

**Questions to consider:**

- Do the distributions look roughly similar in shape across groups?
- Which group appears to have the highest average vocabulary score?
- Which group has the lowest?
- Is the spread (variability) similar across all four groups?
- Are there any obvious outliers?

These observations will be important when we check conditions for ANOVA and interpret our results!

### Comparing Many Means, Visually

Let's develop your intuition about when groups are likely to be "significantly different" from each other.

Look at the three panels below, each showing boxplots for three groups:

```{r means-setup, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)

a1 <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2)
a2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 20, sd = 2)
a3 <- rnorm(100, mean = 30, sd = 2)
a <- c(a1, a2, a3)

b1 <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 5)
b2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 11, sd = 5)
b3 <- rnorm(100, mean = 9, sd = 5)
b <- c(b1, b2, b3)

d1 <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 15)
d2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 20, sd = 15)
d3 <- rnorm(100, mean = 30, sd = 15)
d <- c(d1, d2, d3)

y <- c(a, b, d)
x <- factor(rep(c(rep(1, 100), rep(2, 100), rep(3, 100)), 3))
z <- c(rep("1", 300), rep("2", 300), rep("3", 300))

df <- tibble(x = x, y = y, z = z)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid( ~ z) +
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Response Variable", 
       title = "Three different scenarios for comparing means")
```

```{r quiz_1}
question("Which panel shows groups with means that are MOST likely to be significantly different from each other? Which shows means LEAST likely to be different?",
  correct = "Excellent! Panel 1 shows clear separation between groups with small within-group variability---the groups are most likely significantly different. Panel 2 shows very similar means with lots of overlap---least likely to be different.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  answer("Most likely: 1, least likely: 2", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Most likely: 1, least likely: 3", message = "Not quite. Look at Panel 2---the three boxplots are nearly identical and heavily overlapping. These are less likely to be significantly different than Panel 3."),
  answer("Most likely: 2, least likely: 3", message = "No. In Panel 2, the groups look very similar with lots of overlap---they're unlikely to be significantly different."),
  answer("Most likely: 2, least likely: 1", message = "No. Groups that clearly differ from each other (with less overlap) are MORE likely to be significantly different.")
)
```

**Key insight:** Statistical significance depends on **both** the difference between group means **and** the variability within groups. Large differences with small variability → likely significant. Small differences with large variability → likely not significant.

## ANOVA: The Big Picture

### Why Not Just Do Multiple t-tests?

You might be wondering: We know how to compare two means with a t-test. Why can't we just do several t-tests for every pair of social classes?

**The problem:** Multiple testing inflates the Type I error rate dramatically.

Let's break this down:

- When we set α = 0.05, we're accepting a 5% chance of a false positive (Type I error) for **one** test
- With 4 social classes, we'd need to do ${4 \choose 2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2} = 6$ pairwise comparisons
- The probability of making **at least one** Type I error across all tests grows rapidly

**The math:**

If we conduct $k$ independent tests, each at significance level α:

$$P(\text{at least one Type I error}) = 1 - (1-\alpha)^k$$

For 6 tests at α = 0.05:
$$P(\text{at least one Type I error}) = 1 - (0.95)^6 \approx 0.265$$

That's a 26.5% chance of falsely detecting a difference that doesn't exist! This is called the **multiple comparisons problem** or **multiple testing problem**.

**The solution:** Use ANOVA to test all groups simultaneously with a **single test** that controls the overall Type I error rate at α.

### How ANOVA Works

ANOVA addresses this problem by comparing **two sources of variation** in a single F-test:

1. **Between-group variation:** How much do the group means differ from each other?
2. **Within-group variation:** How much do individual observations vary within each group?

**The logic:**

- If group membership matters (i.e., vocabulary really does differ by class), we expect **large between-group variation** relative to within-group variation
- If group membership doesn't matter, between-group variation should be similar to within-group variation (just random noise)

**The test statistic is called an F-statistic:**

$$F = \frac{\text{Between-group variability}}{\text{Within-group variability}} = \frac{\text{MSG}}{\text{MSE}}$$

Where:
- MSG = Mean Square for Groups (between-group variance)
- MSE = Mean Square Error (within-group variance)

**Interpreting F:**

- **Large F-values** (much greater than 1) suggest group means are different
- **F-values near 1** suggest group means are similar (differences are just noise)
- F-values are always positive (it's a ratio of variances)

The F-distribution helps us determine whether an observed F-value is "unusually large" if the null hypothesis were true.

### Variability Partitioning

ANOVA works by **partitioning** (dividing up) the total variability in the response variable:

$$\text{Total Variability} = \text{Between-group Variability} + \text{Within-group Variability}$$

For our vocabulary score example:

**Total variability** in vocabulary scores = variance in vocabulary scores of all 795 respondents

**Between-group variability** = variability that can be attributed to differences in social class. This is what we're interested in! If social class matters, this component should be large.

**Within-group variability** = variability attributed to factors within each social group. This is essentially "noise"---if everyone in a social class had exactly the same vocabulary score, this would be zero (but that never happens in real data!).

**The key insight:** We want between-group variability to be large **relative to** within-group variability. The F-statistic makes this comparison.

> **Summary of key concepts:**
> 
> - Total variability is partitioned into two components:
>     - **Between-group variability:** differences attributable to the grouping variable
>     - **Within-group variability:** differences within each group (the "noise")
> - ANOVA uses a single F-test to compare all groups simultaneously
> - This controls the Type I error rate (unlike doing multiple t-tests)
> - Large F-statistics suggest the group means differ

Next, we'll formalize this with hypotheses and see what an actual ANOVA looks like!

## Hypotheses and the ANOVA Table

### ANOVA Hypotheses for Vocabulary Scores vs. Social Class

Every ANOVA starts with a pair of hypotheses. Let's state them clearly:

**Null hypothesis (H₀):** The average vocabulary score is the same across all social classes

$$H_0: \mu_{\text{lower}} = \mu_{\text{working}} = \mu_{\text{middle}} = \mu_{\text{upper}}$$

**Alternative hypothesis (Hₐ):** The average vocabulary score for **at least one** social class differs from the others

**Critical point:** The alternative hypothesis is **NOT** that all the groups are different from each other! It only says that **at least one** group mean is different.

Think about it this way:

- ✓ Lower ≠ Upper (but all others equal) → Alternative hypothesis is true
- ✓ Lower ≠ Working ≠ Middle (but Upper = Middle) → Alternative hypothesis is true  
- ✓ All four are different → Alternative hypothesis is true
- ✗ All four are equal → Null hypothesis is true

**Why "at least one"?** The negation (opposite) of "all groups are equal" is "at least one group is different." This is why we need post-hoc tests after ANOVA---to figure out **which** groups differ!

### The ANOVA Table

Here's what the parametric (theoretical) ANOVA output looks like for our vocabulary data:

```{r echo=TRUE}
aov(wordsum ~ class, gss) |>
  tidy()
```

Let's break down each component of this output:

**Row 1 (class):** The "between-group" variability---variation explained by social class

**Row 2 (Residuals):** The "within-group" variability---unexplained variation (the "error")

Now let's examine each column:

### Understanding Sum of Squares

The **Sum of Squares (sumsq)** column measures variability:

- **SS for class (236.56):** Variability in vocabulary scores explained by social class
- **SS for Residuals (2869.80):** Unexplained variability (variation within groups)
- **Total SS = 236.56 + 2869.80 = 3106.36:** Total variability in vocabulary scores

**Sum of Squares Total (SST)** is calculated as the total squared deviation from the overall mean:

$$SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2$$

This is similar to variance, but not divided by n.

**Percentage of variability explained:**

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{\text{class}}}{SS_{\text{total}}} = \frac{236.56}{3106.36} = 0.076 = 7.6\%$$

**Interpretation:** About 7.6% of the variability in vocabulary scores can be explained by self-identified social class. The remaining 92.4% is due to other factors (education, age, reading habits, etc.).

**Note:** This R² is exactly what you'd get from a linear regression predicting wordsum from class!

### Degrees of Freedom (df)

**df for class:** Number of groups - 1 = 4 - 1 = **3**

**df for Residuals:** Total observations - number of groups = 795 - 4 = **791**

Degrees of freedom tell us how many "independent pieces of information" we have for estimating variability.

### Mean Square (meansq)

Mean Square values are the Sum of Squares divided by degrees of freedom:

$$MS = \frac{SS}{df}$$

- **MSG (Mean Square Groups) = 236.56 / 3 = 78.85:** Average between-group variability
- **MSE (Mean Square Error) = 2869.80 / 791 = 3.63:** Average within-group variability

These are variance estimates! Mean squares are how we standardize the variability measures for groups with different degrees of freedom.

### The F-Statistic

The F-statistic is the ratio of between-group to within-group variability:

$$F = \frac{MSG}{MSE} = \frac{78.85}{3.63} = 21.74$$

**Interpretation:** The between-group variability is about 21.74 times larger than the within-group variability. This is a large ratio!

### The p-value

The **p-value (< 0.001)** answers this question: 

*"If the null hypothesis were true (all group means equal), what's the probability of observing an F-statistic this large or larger?"*

Here, p < 0.001 means: extremely unlikely!

**Decision:** Since p-value < α (typically 0.05), we **reject the null hypothesis**.

**Conclusion:** We have very strong evidence that average vocabulary scores differ across at least one pair of social class groups.

**But...** we still don't know **which** groups differ! That's where post-hoc testing comes in (we'll get there soon).

### The F-Distribution

ANOVA uses the F-distribution to calculate p-values. Here's what the F-distribution looks like for our analysis:

```{r echo=TRUE}

obs_stat <- aov(wordsum ~ class, gss) |> 
  tidy() |> 
  select(statistic) |> 
  slice(1) |> 
  pull()

set.seed(1234)

values <- tibble(
  val = rf(100000, df1 = 3, df2 = 791)
)

values |> 
ggplot(aes(x = val)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  xlim(c(0, 25)) + 
  labs(x = "F-statistic", 
       y = "Density", 
       title = "F-distribution with df1 = 3, df2 = 791") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_stat, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate("text", x = obs_stat + 2, y = 0.4, 
           label = paste("Observed F =", round(obs_stat, 2)), 
           color = "red")
```

**Key features of the F-distribution:**

- Always positive (it's a ratio of two variances)
- Right-skewed
- Defined by two degrees of freedom parameters (df₁ and df₂)
- For ANOVA, we **only** use the upper (right) tail to calculate p-values

The red dashed line shows our observed F-statistic (21.74). It's way out in the right tail---extremely unlikely if H₀ were true!

## Conducting Your Own ANOVA

Time to put this into practice!

### ANOVA for Evaluation Score vs. Professor Rank

Let's conduct an ANOVA using different data. The `evals` dataset contains course evaluation scores for professors at the University of Texas at Austin, along with various characteristics including their academic rank.

**Research question:** Is there a difference in average evaluation scores between professors of different ranks?

The `rank` variable has three levels:
- teaching: Teaching faculty
- tenure track: Tenure-track faculty (assistant/associate professors)
- tenured: Tenured (full) professors

**Your task:**

- Use the `aov()` function to perform an ANOVA testing whether evaluation `score` differs by professor `rank`
- Store the result as `aov_evals_rank`
- Use `tidy()` to view a clean summary of the ANOVA table
- Interpret the results at α = 0.025 (2.5% significance level)

```{r vocabulary_2, exercise=TRUE}
# Run an analysis of variance on score vs. rank
aov_evals_rank <- aov(___, data = ___)

# Tidy the model
tidy(___)
```

```{r vocabulary_2-hint}
# Hints:
# - Call `aov()` with a formula: response ~ grouping_variable
# - The formula should be: score ~ rank
# - Use the `evals` dataset
# - Call `tidy()` on the stored ANOVA object
```

```{r vocabulary_2-solution}
# Run an analysis of variance on score vs. rank
aov_evals_rank <- aov(score ~ rank, data = evals)

# Tidy the model
tidy(aov_evals_rank)
```

### Interpreting Your Results

Now that you've run the ANOVA, answer these questions:

1. **What is the F-statistic?** Is it large?
2. **What is the p-value?** Is it less than α = 0.025?
3. **What is your decision?** Reject or fail to reject H₀?
4. **What is your conclusion in context?** Do evaluation scores appear to differ by professor rank?

**Bonus question:** Would your conclusion change if you had used a 10% significance level (α = 0.10) instead?

Take a moment to write out your interpretation before moving on!

## Conditions for ANOVA

### Why Conditions Matter

Just like any statistical inference method, ANOVA has mathematical conditions that must be reasonably satisfied for the results to be trustworthy.

**Important note:** We can never mathematically "prove" conditions are perfectly met with real data. Instead, we use careful evaluation to assess whether conditions are reasonably satisfied or seriously violated.

### Three Main Conditions for ANOVA

1. **Independence:** 
   - Within groups: sampled observations must be independent of each other
   - Between groups: the groups themselves must be independent

2. **Approximate normality:** 
   - The response variable should be approximately normal **within each group**
   
3. **Equal variance (homoscedasticity):** 
   - The variability should be roughly equal across all groups

Let's examine each condition in detail and learn how to check them.

### Condition 1: Independence

**Within groups:** Sampled observations must be independent of each other

How to verify:
- ✓ **Random sampling** ensures independence
- ✓ For experiments: random assignment helps (but consider potential relationships)
- ✓ No obvious clustering or time dependencies

**Between groups:** Groups must be independent of each other

What to watch for:
- ✗ **Paired or repeated measures:** Same subjects measured in multiple groups
- ✗ **Matched samples:** Groups deliberately matched on characteristics
- ✓ **Different subjects** in each group

**For our GSS vocabulary data:**

- ✓ The GSS uses random sampling → within-group independence satisfied
- ✓ Each respondent appears in only one social class group → between-group independence satisfied

**Important:** This condition is **always critical** but sometimes difficult to verify without knowing the study design details.

### Condition 2: Approximate Normality

**Requirement:** The response variable should be approximately normal **within each group**. Note: this is the same as saying the normality of the residuals since residuals = observed - group mean.

**When it matters most:** When sample sizes are **small** (n < 30 per group)

**When it matters less:** When sample sizes are **large**, ANOVA is fairly robust to violations of normality (thanks to the Central Limit Theorem)

**How to check:**

- Create visualizations **for each group separately:**
  - Histograms or density plots (check for symmetry, outliers)
  - Q-Q plots (points should fall roughly on a straight line)
  - Violin plots (show full distribution shape)


- Look for:
  - ✓ Roughly symmetric distributions
  - ✓ No extreme outliers
  - ⚠ Moderate skewness is usually okay with large samples
  - ✗ Severe skewness or heavy outliers in small samples

**Which visualization is best for checking normality?**

```{r quiz_2}
question("Which of the following provides the MOST complete information for checking the normality condition for the vocabulary score ANOVA?",
  correct = "Excellent! A violin plot shows the full shape of the distribution within each group, making it easy to assess normality visually. You can see symmetry, skewness, modality, and outliers all at once.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  answer("Violin plot of vocabulary scores, faceted by social class", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Boxplot of vocabulary scores, faceted by social class", message = "Boxplots are useful, but they only show 5 summary statistics (median, quartiles, min/max) plus outliers. They don't show the full shape of the distribution, so you can't fully assess normality."),
  answer("Means and standard deviations of vocabulary scores in each social class", message = "These are just two numbers---they don't tell you anything about the shape of the distribution. A symmetric distribution and a skewed distribution could have the same mean and SD!"),
  answer("Number of modes of vocabulary scores in each social class", message = "Modality (one peak vs. multiple peaks) is just one aspect of shape. This doesn't tell you about symmetry, outliers, or other features needed to assess normality.")
)
```

### Condition 3: Constant (Equal) Variance

**Requirement:** The variability of the response variable should be roughly equal across all groups

**Technical term:** Homoscedasticity (homo = same, scedastic = scatter)

**When it matters most:** When sample sizes **differ substantially** between groups

**When it matters less:** When sample sizes are **balanced** (roughly equal), ANOVA is fairly robust

**How to check:**

1. **Visual inspection:**
   - Boxplots: Check if box heights and whisker lengths are similar
   - Violin plots: Check if widths are similar
   - Residual plots: Points should be equally scattered at all fitted values

2. **Numerical summary:**
   - Calculate standard deviations for each group
   - **Rule of thumb:** Largest SD should be no more than 2× the smallest SD
   - If max(SD) / min(SD) > 2, equal variance might be violated

Let's check this condition for our vocabulary data!

### Checking Equal Variance: Numerical Approach

Calculate the standard deviation of vocabulary scores within each social class group.

**Your task:**

1. Take the `gss` dataset and `group_by()` social `class`
2. Use `summarize()` to calculate the standard deviation (`sd()`) of `wordsum`
3. Store the result in a column called `sd_wordsum`
4. Examine the results: Is the ratio of largest to smallest SD less than 2?

```{r vocabulary_3, exercise=TRUE}
gss |>
  # Group by class
  group_by(___) |>
  # Calculate the std dev of wordsum as sd_wordsum
  summarize(___ = ___)
```

```{r vocabulary_3-hint}
# Hints:
# - Call `group_by()`, passing `class` as the argument
# - In `summarize()`, create `sd_wordsum` by calling `sd(wordsum)`
# - After running, look at the SD values: 
#   Is the largest about 2x the smallest or more?
```

```{r vocabulary_3-solution}
gss |>
  # Group by class
  group_by(class) |>
  # Calculate the std dev of wordsum as sd_wordsum
  summarize(sd_wordsum = sd(wordsum))
```

### Checking Equal Variance: Visual Approach

Standard deviations give us numbers, but visualizations help us **see** the variability.

**Your task:** Create density ridge plots to visualize the distribution of vocabulary scores across social classes.

**Steps:**

1. Pipe the `gss` dataset into `ggplot()`
2. Map `wordsum` to the x-axis and `class` to the y-axis in `aes()`
3. Add density ridges using `geom_density_ridges()`
4. Examine the plot: Do the distributions have similar spread?

```{r vocabulary_4, exercise=TRUE}
gss |>
  # Map wordsum to the x-axis and class to the y-axis
  ggplot(aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
  # Add density ridges to the plot! 
  geom_density_ridges()
```

```{r vocabulary_4-hint}
# Hints:
# - Map x = wordsum (the response variable)
# - Map y = class (the grouping variable)
# - geom_density_ridges() is already provided!
# - Look at the widths of the density curves
```

```{r vocabulary_4-solution}
gss |>
  # Map wordsum to the x-axis and class to the y-axis
  ggplot(aes(x = wordsum, y = class)) +
  # Add density ridges to the plot! 
  geom_density_ridges()
```

### Reflection: Is Equal Variance Satisfied?

Look at both your numerical summaries and the density ridges plot.

**Questions to consider:**

- Do the standard deviations differ by more than a factor of 2?
- Do the density curves have visibly different widths?
- If there are some differences, are they minor or substantial?

**For our data:** The standard deviations are pretty similar across groups (ranging roughly from 1.8 to 2.0), and the density curves show comparable spread. The equal variance condition appears reasonably satisfied!

### Checking Conditions: Model-Based Approach

We can also check normality and equal variance using **residual plots** from the fitted model, similar to what we did for linear regression.

The `ggfortify` package makes this easy with the `autoplot()` function:

```{r echo=TRUE}
autoplot(lm(wordsum ~ factor(class), gss), which = 2:3)
```

**Left plot (Q-Q plot):** Checks normality of residuals

- Points should fall roughly along the diagonal line
- Our data: Mostly linear with large deviations at the tails; normality is probably violated

**Right plot (Scale-Location):** Checks equal variance

- The red smoothed line should be roughly horizontal
- Points should be evenly scattered above and below
- Our data: The line is fairly flat---equal variance assumption is reasonable

**Overall assessment for the vocabulary ANOVA:**

- ✓ Independence: Satisfied (random sampling, large population)
- ✓ Normality: Reasonably satisfied (Q-Q plot doesn't look great but large sample size is reassuring)
- ✓ Equal variance: Reasonably satisfied (SDs similar, scale-location plot okay)

**Conclusion:** We can proceed, with some caution, in our ANOVA 

## Post-Hoc Testing with emmeans

### The Next Question: Which Groups Differ?

We conducted our ANOVA and found a significant result (p < 0.001). This tells us that **at least one** social class group has a different average vocabulary score (i.e., we reject the omnibus null hypothesis).

**But which ones?** 

- Is lower class different from upper class?
- Is working class different from middle class?
- Are all four groups different from each other?

ANOVA doesn't answer these questions --- it only tells us "something differs somewhere."

To answer the "which groups?" question, we need **post-hoc tests** (Latin for "after this") --- tests conducted **after** finding a significant ANOVA result.

### The Multiple Comparisons Problem: Revisited

Earlier, we saw why doing multiple t-tests inflates the Type I error rate. Let's see this more concretely.

**Scenario:** Imagine you're testing 20 fair coins to see if they're biased. For each coin, you set α = 0.05.

- For each individual coin test: 5% chance of falsely concluding it's biased
- Across all 20 tests: You'd expect to falsely "detect" bias in about 1 coin purely by chance!

$$P(\text{at least one Type I error}) = 1 - (1-\alpha)^k$$

For our vocabulary data with **4 groups**, we have ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ possible pairwise comparisons:

1. Lower vs. Working
2. Lower vs. Middle  
3. Lower vs. Upper
4. Working vs. Middle
5. Working vs. Upper
6. Middle vs. Upper

At α = 0.05 per test:
$$P(\text{at least one false positive}) = 1 - (0.95)^6 \approx 0.265$$

That's a **26.5% chance** of making at least one Type I error! Our "5% significance level" is meaningless.

**The solution:** Adjust our significance level to control the **family-wise error rate** (FWER) or **false discovery rate** (FDR).

### Why Use emmeans?

The `emmeans` package (**e**stimated **m**arginal **means**) is a modern, principled approach to post-hoc testing. Here's why it's better than doing individual t-tests:

1. **Pools information across groups:** Uses the overall MSE (pooled variance) from the ANOVA model, giving more stable estimates

2. **Handles complex designs:** Works seamlessly with unbalanced designs, covariates, and interactions (we will cover this later in the semester)

3. **Multiple comparison adjustments:** Easily implements Bonferroni, Holm, Tukey, FDR, and many other adjustments

4. **Consistent framework:** Same syntax works for ANOVA, regression, mixed models, and more

5. **Clear output:** Provides confidence intervals and adjusted p-values in easy-to-read tables

**Key concept:** Instead of doing separate t-tests (which ignore the ANOVA), emmeans uses the **fitted ANOVA model** to estimate group means and make comparisons.

### Adjustment Methods: What's the Difference?

There are several methods for adjusting p-values in multiple comparisons. Each makes different trade-offs between conservativeness and power:

#### 1. Bonferroni Correction

**Method:** Multiply each p-value by the number of comparisons (or equivalently, divide α by the number of comparisons)

$$p_{\text{adjusted}} = p \times k \quad \text{or} \quad \alpha^* = \frac{\alpha}{k}$$

**Pros:** 
- Very simple to understand and calculate
- Controls FWER (family-wise error rate) strictly
- Works for any type of comparisons

**Cons:**
- Very conservative (loses power)
- Treats all comparisons as equally important
- Can miss real differences when doing many tests

**When to use:** When you want strict control over Type I errors and have relatively few comparisons

#### 2. Holm Method (Sequential Bonferroni)

**Method:** This is also known as the Holm-Bonferroni adjustment. Order p-values from smallest to largest, then apply decreasing adjustments

1. Multiply smallest p-value by k
2. Multiply second smallest by k-1
3. Continue until all adjusted
4. Ensure monotonicity (adjusted p-values never decrease)

**Pros:**
- Always more powerful than Bonferroni
- Still controls FWER strictly (like Bonferroni)
- Nearly as easy to understand

**Cons:**
- Still somewhat conservative
- Requires ordering comparisons

**When to use:** Default choice for FWER control --- uniformly better than Bonferroni! Downside is it can not be applied to confidence intervals.

#### 3. FDR (False Discovery Rate) - Benjamini & Hochberg

**Method:** Controls the expected proportion of false discoveries among rejected hypotheses

Instead of controlling: "What's the probability of ANY false positive?" (FWER)

Controls: "What proportion of our 'discoveries' are false?" (FDR)

**Pros:**
- Much more powerful than Bonferroni/Holm
- Appropriate for exploratory analysis
- Good when doing VERY many comparisons

**Cons:**
- Allows some false positives (by design)
- Less strict control than FWER methods
- Requires more explanation

**When to use:** When you have many comparisons and can tolerate some false positives, especially in exploratory research

#### 4. Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference)

**Method:** Uses the studentized range distribution (q) to adjust for multiple comparisons for all possible pairwise comparisons

**Specifically designed for pairwise comparisons in ANOVA**

**Pros:**
- Optimal for **all pairwise comparisons** in ANOVA
- More powerful than Bonferroni for this specific case
- Gold standard for balanced designs with pairwise comparisons
- Provides simultaneous confidence intervals

**Cons:**
- Only works for pairwise comparisons!
- Slightly more complex calculation
- Assumes equal sample sizes work best (but handles unequal sizes)

**When to use:** When you want to compare **all pairs** of groups after ANOVA---this is the standard choice!

### Comparison Summary Table

| Method | Controls | Power | Best Use Case |
|--------|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Bonferroni** | FWER | Lowest | Few comparisons, need simplicity |
| **Holm** | FWER | Low-Medium | General purpose, better than Bonferroni |
| **Tukey HSD** | FWER | Medium | All pairwise comparisons in ANOVA |
| **FDR** | FDR | Highest | Many comparisons, exploratory research |

For our vocabulary ANOVA with 6 pairwise comparisons:
- **Tukey HSD** is probably the best choice (designed for this situation)
- **Holm** is a good alternative for strict FWER control
- **FDR** if we want maximum power
- **Bonferroni** is overly conservative but simple

Let's try all four and compare!

### Using emmeans: Step by Step

Let's conduct post-hoc comparisons for the vocabulary ANOVA using `emmeans`.

**Step 1:** Fit the ANOVA model (we've already done this!)

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Fit ANOVA model
vocab_aov <- aov(wordsum ~ class, data = gss)
```

**Step 2:** Estimate marginal means for each social class

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Estimate marginal means
vocab_means <- emmeans(vocab_aov, specs = ~ class)
vocab_means
```

**Interpretation:** These are the estimated mean vocabulary scores for each social class, along with standard errors and confidence intervals. Notice they're based on the **model**, not just raw group means.

**Step 3:** Conduct pairwise comparisons with different adjustments

Let's compare all four methods side by side:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# All pairwise comparisons with different adjustments
pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "bonferroni")
```

Now try the others! Let's create a comparison of all four methods.

### Your Turn: Compare Adjustment Methods

**Your task:** Run pairwise comparisons using all four adjustment methods and compare the results.

**Steps:**

1. Fit the ANOVA model: `vocab_aov <- aov(wordsum ~ class, data = gss)`
2. Get estimated marginal means: `vocab_means <- emmeans(vocab_aov, ~ class)`
3. Run pairwise comparisons with each adjustment:
   - `pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "bonferroni")`
   - `pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "holm")`
   - `pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "fdr")`
   - `pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "tukey")`

```{r vocabulary_5, exercise=TRUE}
# Fit the ANOVA model
vocab_aov <- aov(wordsum ~ class, data = gss)

# Estimate marginal means
vocab_means <- emmeans(vocab_aov, ~ class)

# Bonferroni adjustment
pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "bonferroni")

# Holm adjustment
pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "holm")

# FDR adjustment  
pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "fdr")

# Tukey HSD
pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "tukey")
```

```{r vocabulary_5-hint}
# The code is already provided! Just run it.
# Compare the adjusted p-values across methods.
# Questions to consider:
# - Which method gives the smallest adjusted p-values?
# - Which comparisons are significant under each method?
# - How much do the adjustments differ?
```

```{r vocabulary_5-solution}
# Fit the ANOVA model
vocab_aov <- aov(wordsum ~ class, data = gss)

# Estimate marginal means
vocab_means <- emmeans(vocab_aov, ~ class)

# Bonferroni adjustment (most conservative)
cat("=== Bonferroni ===\n")
pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "bonferroni")

# Holm adjustment (less conservative than Bonferroni)
cat("\n=== Holm ===\n")
pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "holm")

# FDR adjustment (controls false discovery rate)
cat("\n=== FDR ===\n")
pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "fdr")

# Tukey HSD (optimal for all pairwise comparisons)
cat("\n=== Tukey HSD ===\n")
pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "tukey")

# Get a tidy version for easier comparison
cat("\n=== Tidy comparison table ===\n")
list(
  Bonferroni = pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "bonferroni"),
  Holm = pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "holm"),
  FDR = pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "fdr"),
  Tukey = pairs(vocab_means, adjust = "tukey")
) |>
  map_dfr(~ as_tibble(.x), .id = "method") |>
  select(method, contrast, estimate, p.value) |>
  arrange(contrast, method)
```

### Interpreting the Results

Let's compare what we found across all four methods.

**Key observations:**

1. **Estimate column:** The estimated differences between means are **identical** across all methods---adjustment doesn't change the estimates, only how we evaluate them!

2. **P-value comparisons:** Looking at adjusted p-values from least to most conservative:
   - **FDR:** Most liberal (smallest adjusted p-values, most discoveries)
   - **Tukey:** Moderate
   - **Holm:** More conservative
   - **Bonferroni:** Most conservative (largest adjusted p-values)

3. **Significant comparisons:** Which comparisons are significant (p < 0.05) under each method?
   - **FDR:** Most comparisons likely significant
   - **Tukey/Holm:** Moderate number significant
   - **Bonferroni:** Fewest significant (might miss real differences)

**Practical question:** Do the data provide convincing evidence of a difference between the average vocabulary scores of:

- **Lower class vs. Upper class?** → Check this comparison!
- **Middle class vs. Lower class?** → Check this one too!
- **Working class vs. Middle class?** → And this one!



### Visualizing the Comparisons

A plot can help us see which groups differ. Let's visualize the estimated means with confidence intervals:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Plot estimated marginal means
plot(vocab_means, comparisons = TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Estimated Mean Vocabulary Score",
       y = "Social Class",
       title = "Estimated Marginal Means with 95% CIs") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The blue bars are confidence intervals for the EMMs, and the red arrows are for the comparisons among them. If an arrow from one mean overlaps an arrow from another group, the difference is not "significant"” based on the adjust setting (which defaults to "tukey" in `emmeans`) and the value of alpha (which defaults to 0.05). 

Note: Don’t ever use confidence intervals for EMMs to perform comparisons; they can be very misleading. Use the comparison arrows instead; or better yet, use pwpp().

A caution: it really is not good practice to draw a bright distinction based on whether or not a P value exceeds some cutoff. This display does dim such distinctions somewhat by allowing the viewer to judge whether a P value is close to alpha one way or the other; but a better strategy is to simply obtain all the P values using pairs(), and look at them individually.

We can also use `pwpp()` to create a more detailed plot of pairwise comparisons:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Plot estimated marginal means
pwpp(vocab_means) +
  labs(
       title = "Pairwise Comparisons") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Each comparison is associated with a vertical line segment that joins the scale positions of the two EMMs being compared, and whose horizontal position is determined by the P value of that comparison.

This kind of plot can get quite “busy” as the number of means being compared goes up...

### Which Adjustment Should You Use?

**General recommendations:**

1. **For all pairwise comparisons in ANOVA:** Use **Tukey HSD** (the gold standard; also known as Tukey-Kramer when sample sizes are unequal)

2. **For a small number of planned comparisons:** Use **Holm** (more powerful than traditional Bonferroni)

3. **For many comparisons in exploratory research:** Use **FDR** (more power)

4. **When you need to explain to non-statisticians:** Use **Bonferroni** (simplest to explain, though overly conservative)

**For our vocabulary analysis:** Tukey HSD is probably the best choice since we're comparing all pairs of groups after a significant ANOVA.

**Important:** Always **pre-specify** which adjustment method you'll use before looking at the data! Otherwise, you might be tempted to choose the method that gives you the "best" results (p-hacking).

### Communicating Results

When reporting post-hoc test results, include:

1. **Which method you used and why**
   - "We used Tukey's HSD adjustment to control the family-wise error rate across all 6 pairwise comparisons."

2. **Significant findings**
   - "We found significant differences between middle class and lower class (p < 0.001, d = 1.6 words) and between middle class and working class (p < 0.001, d = 1 word)."

3. **Non-significant findings** (especially if important!)
   - "We found no significant difference between working class and upper class (p = 0.80)."

4. **Effect sizes**
   - Report actual differences in means, not just p-values

**Remember:** Statistical significance tells us if differences are unlikely to be exactly *zero*. Practical significance tells us if differences matter in the real world!

Overall, post-hoc testing with `emmeans` provides a powerful, flexible, and principled way to explore group differences after ANOVA. Additionally, after inspecting the results with `emmeans`, our interpretation is very interesting because we can see that the means differ between the lower and middle classes, and between the working and middle classes, but not between the lower and working classes, or between the upper class and any of the other classes. This suggests that the middle class is driving the differences in vocabulary scores.
