<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn about simple linear regression - a
fundamental statistical technique for understanding relationships
between two numeric variables. By the end, you’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualize and interpret regression lines</li>
<li>Understand the least squares criterion</li>
<li>Fit and interpret linear models in R</li>
<li>Distinguish between regression modeling and regression to the
mean</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-visualization-of-linear-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualization of linear models</h2>
<p>Before we get into the mathematical specification for a regression
model, let’s build some intuition about what a regression line is.</p>
<p>In this scatterplot, we see the relationship between the total length
of a possum, and the corresponding length of its tail. Clearly there is
not a perfect relationship here: the total length of the possum varies
even for possums with the same tail length. But we still have some
intuitive desire to describe the relationship with a line.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_l)) +
  geom_point()</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-simple-linear_files/figure-html/1-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<div id="section-picking-a-line-of-best-fit" class="section level2">
<h2>Picking a line of best fit</h2>
<div id="section-through-the-origin" class="section level3">
<h3>Through the origin</h3>
<p>In the plot below, we’ve superimposed a line that goes through the
origin - that is, the point where both <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are equal to zero. The line has a slope
of 2.5 centimeters (of total length) per centimeter (of tail length). We
notice that, in some sense, the line does go “through” the points, but
doesn’t capture the general trend as best we could imagine.</p>
<p><img src="ims-simple-linear_files/figure-html/2-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-through-the-origin-better-fit" class="section level3">
<h3>Through the origin, better fit</h3>
<p>This line also goes through the origin, but has a gentler slope of
2.3 cm (of total length) per cm (of tail length). It seems like a
“better” fit, since it cuts through the points in a more central
way.</p>
<p><img src="ims-simple-linear_files/figure-html/3-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-not-through-the-origin" class="section level3">
<h3>Not through the origin</h3>
<p>But why should we force the line to go through the origin? Here is a
line that has a <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept of 40
cm, and an even gentler slope of 1.3 . It seems like an even better fit
still.</p>
<p>Do you think you could find an even better fit? In order to do so,
you need some criteria for judging which line fits better. In
particular, you need a numerical measurement of how good the fit of each
possible line is.</p>
<p><img src="ims-simple-linear_files/figure-html/4-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-best-fit-line" class="section level3">
<h3>The “best” fit line</h3>
<p>Notice how each line captures the data differently: - <strong>Through
origin (slope 2.5)</strong>: Too steep, misses the pattern -
<strong>Through origin (slope 2.3)</strong>: Better, but still
constrained - <strong>With intercept (slope 1.3)</strong>: Best captures
the overall trend</p>
<p><strong>Question to consider</strong>: Why might forcing a line
through the origin be unrealistic for this data?</p>
<p>The simple linear regression model for a numeric response as a
function of a numeric explanatory variable can be visualized on the
corresponding scatterplot by a straight line.</p>
<p>In regression, we use the least squares criterion to determine the
best fit line. Statisticians have proven that (apart from pathological
examples) if we seek the line that tries to minimize the sum of the
squared distances between the line and a set of data points, a unique
line exists. That line is called the “least squares regression
line.”</p>
<p>We might consider linear regression to be a specific example of a
larger class of <em>smooth</em> models. The <code>geom_smooth()</code>
function allows you to draw such models over a scatterplot of the data
itself. This technique is known as visualizing the model <em>in the data
space</em>. The <code>method</code> argument to
<code>geom_smooth()</code> allows you to specify what class of smooth
model you want to see. Since we are exploring linear models, we’ll set
this argument to the value <code>"lm"</code>.</p>
<p>We can add the line to our plot using the <code>geom_smooth()</code>
function and specifying the <code>method</code> argument to be
<code>"lm"</code>, which stands for “linear model”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_l)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-simple-linear_files/figure-html/5-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-ignore-standard-errors" class="section level3">
<h3>Ignore standard errors</h3>
<p>Note that by default, this will draw the regression line in blue,
with gray shading for the standard error associated with the line. That
should not concern us just yet, so we can turn it off by setting the
<code>se</code> argument to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_l)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE)</code></pre>

<h3>Uniqueness of least squares regression line</h3>
<p>The least squares criterion implies that the slope of the regression

it on the scatterplot of height and weight.</p>

<div id="section-understanding-linear-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Understanding Linear Models</h2>
<p>Models are ubiquitous in statistics. In many cases, we assume that
the value of our response variable is some function of our explanatory
variable, plus some random noise. The latter term is important, and in a
philosophical sense, is the focus of statistical thinking.</p>
<p>What we are saying here is that there is some mathematical function
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, which can translate values of
one variable into values of another, except that there is some
randomness in the process. What often distinguishes statisticians from
other quantitative researchers is the way that we try to model that
random noise.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  response = f(explanatory) + noise
\]</span></p>
<div id="section-linear-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Linear model</h3>
<p>For a linear regression model, we simply assume that <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> takes the form of a linear function.
Thus, our model describes the value of the response variable in terms of
what creates a line (an intercept and a slope).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  response = intercept + slope \cdot explanatory + noise
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="section-regression-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Regression model</h3>
<p>In a regression model, we use Greek letters for the intercept and
slope, indicating that they are population parameters which we hope to
estimate with our sample.</p>
<p>The intercept is notated as <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and the slope is notated as <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>. The noise term in a regression
is often denoted <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. In a
regression, we assume that the noise terms have a Normal distribution,
centered at 0 with a known standard deviation of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_\epsilon\)</span>. The equation below is
what we call our “population” regression equation, symbolizing that it
is for the population we are interested in studying.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot X + \epsilon \,, \qquad \epsilon \sim N(0,
\sigma_\epsilon)
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="section-fitted-values" class="section level3">
<h3>Fitted values</h3>
<p>When we estimate our population regression equation with data, we
need to indicate that our intercept and slope values are estimates for
the <em>true</em> population intercept and slope.</p>
<p>We do this by changing our equation in four ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is changed to <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span>, as we are now estimating the
mean response rather than an individual response.</li>
<li>The error terms (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>) are
removed, as we are no longer modeling individual responses.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is replaced with
<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\beta_0}\)</span>, notating that
this is an estimate of the true intercept.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is replaced with
<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\beta_1}\)</span>, notating that
this is an estimate of the true slope.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting model looks like:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot X
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="section-residuals" class="section level3">
<h3>Residuals</h3>
<p>The difference between what was observed in the data and what was
predicted from the regression line is what we call a “residual.”
Obervations that lie above the regression line exceeded their predicted
value and have a positive residual. Values below the regression line are
less than their predicted value and have a negative residual.</p>
<p>The residuals are the realization of the noise term from the
population regression equation. While <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> play analogous roles in the regression
equation, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is an unknown,
true quantity, while <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is a known,
estimate of that quantity.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  e = Y - \hat{Y}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="section-fitting-procedure" class="section level3">
<h3>Fitting procedure</h3>
<p>While we won’t delve into the specifics of the least squares fitting
procedure, we will outline what it does. It is intuitive that we would
want a line that has small residuals. As discussed in the <a
href="https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/intro-linear-models.html#least-squares-regression">Introduction
to Modern Statistics textbook</a>, it is common practice to choose a
line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals.</p>
<p>In this procedure, the residual for each observation is squared and
all of the squared residuals are added up. You can think of the use of
the squared error as saying that “a residual twice as large as another
residual is more than twice as bad.” In other words, overestimating by 4
is more than twice as bad as overestimating by 2.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-least-squares" class="section level3">
<h3>Least squares</h3>
<p>Actually computing the fitted coefficients is usually a messy
business for which the computer is much better suited than we are, so we
won’t discuss that here. You should know that the least squares fitting
procedure is a well-understood, relatively straightforward,
deterministic process that can be computed efficiently. It will always
return a unique solution, except in rare, unrealistic cases.</p>
<p>Your regression line will always have two attributes, (1) the
residuals will always sum to 0, and (2) the point <span
class="math inline">\((\bar{x}, \bar{y})\)</span> is guaranteed to lie
on the regression line. Given your understanding of correlation, it
should not surprise you to learn that the regression slope and the
correlation coefficient are closely-related. In fact, they are
proportional to one another.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that there are other criteria—apart from
least squares—for choosing a line of “best” fit, but we won’t talk about
them in this tutorial.</p>

<h2>Fitting a linear model “by hand”</h2>
<p>Recall the simple linear regression model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    y = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x
\]</span></p>
<p>Two facts enable you to compute the slope <span
class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> and intercept <span
class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> of a simple linear regression model
from some basic summary statistics.</p>
<p>First, the slope can be defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    b_1 = r_{x,y} \cdot \frac{s_y}{s_x}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(r_{x,y}\)</span> represents the
correlation (<code>cor()</code>) of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s_x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(s_y\)</span> represent the standard deviation
(<code>sd()</code>) of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>Second, the point <span class="math inline">\((\bar{x},
\bar{y})\)</span> is <em>always</em> on the least squares regression
line, where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span> denote the average of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will find the slope and intercept of the least
squares regression line for body weight (<span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) as a function of height (<span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>). But, you might need to do some
algebra to solve for <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>!</p>

<h2>Regression vs. regression to the mean</h2>
<div id="section-heredity" class="section level3">
<h3>Heredity</h3>
<p>In the late 19th century, Sir Francis Galton developed much of the
theory surrounding correlation and regression. One of the more enduring
concepts is “regression to the mean.” Here we note that “regression to
the mean” is a distinct concept from “linear regression”, which is the
focus of this tutorial. But “regression to the mean” is an important
statistical concept in its own right, so we will explore it here so that
you can appreciate the difference.</p>
<p>As an example of Galton’s “regression to the mean”, consider
analyzing the heights of the children of NBA players.</p>
<p>As always, it’s best to start with a question: Do tall men tend to
beget tall sons? Do tall women tend to have tall daughters? You might
consider this question in the context of NBA and WNBA players. Do you
suspect that children of NBA and WNBA players are likely to be tall?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-galtons-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Galton’s data</h3>
<p>The answer turns out to be “yes, but not as tall as their fathers.”
This effect is what Galton deemed “regression to the mean”. Another way
of thinking about this is that unusual phenomena are likely to become
more common over time.</p>
<p>In the plot, we see the relationship between the heights of a group
of 465 men that Galton measured in the 1880s, and their fathers. The
height of the son is on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis,
while the height of the corresponding father is on the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis. The diagonal indicates sons who
are as tall as their fathers. The slope of the regression line—shown in
blue—is more gentle. This reflects the observation that while tall
fathers are still likely to have tall sons, the sons are not likely to
be <em>as tall</em> as their fathers. Their height has been “regressed”
towards the mean height.</p>
<p>In the plot below, pay attention to: - The <strong>blue regression
line</strong> (what actually happens) - The <strong>dashed diagonal
line</strong> (if children were exactly as tall as parents) - The
<strong>gap between them</strong> (evidence of regression to the
mean)</p>
<p>If tall fathers had equally tall sons, what would the slope be?
Compare this to what you observe.</p>
<p><img src="ims-simple-linear_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It may be tempting to think that regression to the mean implies that
men are getting shorter, but this is not true. Even in this sample, the
mean height of the sons was the same—to the nearest tenth of an inch—to
those of the fathers.</p>

<div id="section-regression-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3>Regression modeling</h3>
<p>This tutorial is about simple linear regression <em>modeling</em>.
Typically, regression models combine some explanatory variables into an
estimate for a single, numerical response variable. We are pursuing
least squares regression models, but there are any number of alternative
regression model specifications. Additionally, there are models like
“regression trees” that also estimate a single, numerical response, but
do not use a linear framework as we do in this tutorial.</p>
<p>“Regression”: techniques for modeling a quantitative response can
include a variety of models including:<br />
- Least squares<br />
- Weighted<br />
- Generalized<br />
- Nonparametric<br />
- Ridge<br />
- Bayesian<br />
- …</p>
<p>The next exercises will allow you to explore Galton’s data on your
own.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-regression-to-the-mean" class="section level3">
<h3>Regression to the mean</h3>
<p><em>Regression to the mean</em> is a concept attributed to Sir
Francis Galton. The basic idea is that extreme random observations will
tend to be less extreme upon a second trial. This is simply due to
chance alone. While “regression to the mean” and “linear regression” are
not the same thing, we will examine them together in this exercise.</p>
<p>One way to see the effects of regression to the mean is to compare
the heights of parents to their children’s heights. While it is true
that tall mothers and fathers tend to have tall children, those children
tend to be less tall than their parents, relative to average. That is,
fathers who are 3 inches taller than the average father tend to have
children who may be taller than average, but by less than 3 inches.</p>
<p>The <code>Galton_men</code> and <code>Galton_women</code> datasets
contain data originally collected by Galton himself in the 1880s on the
heights of men and women, respectively, along with their parents’
heights.</p>
<p>Compare the slope of the regression line to the slope of the diagonal
line. What does this tell you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a scatterplot of the height of men as a function of their
father’s height. Add the simple linear regression line and a diagonal
line (with slope equal to 1 and intercept equal to 0) to the plot.</li>
<li>Create a scatterplot of the height of women as a function of their
mother’s height. Add the simple linear regression line and a diagonal
line to the plot.</li>
