<h2>Introduction to Generalized Linear Models</h2>
<div id="section-beyond-linear-regression" class="section level3">
<h3>Beyond Linear Regression</h3>
<p>So far in your statistical journey, you’ve primarily worked with
<strong>linear regression</strong>, where the response variable is
continuous and approximately normally distributed. But what happens when
your response variable doesn’t meet these assumptions?</p>
<ul>
<li>What if you want to predict whether a student gets
<strong>accepted</strong> or <strong>rejected</strong> (binary
outcome)?</li>
<li>What if you’re counting the <strong>number of emails</strong>
received per day (count data)?</li>
<li>What if you’re modeling <strong>survival time</strong> (positive and
skewed)?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where <strong>Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)</strong> come
to the rescue!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-glm-framework" class="section level3">
<h3>The GLM Framework</h3>
<p>Generalized Linear Models extend the linear regression framework to
accommodate response variables from different probability distributions.
The key innovation is the use of a <strong>link function</strong> that
transforms the response variable to connect it with a linear combination
of predictors.</p>
<p><strong>The GLM Structure:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E(Y) = g^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 +
\beta_2 x_2 + \ldots)\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the <strong>link
function</strong> that maps the expected value of Y to the linear
predictor.</p>

<h3>Focus on Binary Outcomes</h3>
<p>In this tutorial, we’ll focus on modeling <strong>binary
outcomes</strong> using the <strong>binomial family</strong> of GLMs.
The most common approach is <strong>logistic regression</strong>, which
uses the <strong>logit link function</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{logit}(p) =
\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 +
\ldots\]</span></p>
<p>This ensures that predicted probabilities always fall between 0 and
1—a critical requirement!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-alternative-link-functions-for-binary-data"
class="section level3">
<h3>Alternative Link Functions for Binary Data</h3>
<p>While logistic regression is the most popular choice for binary
outcomes, two alternatives exist:</p>
<p><strong>Probit Regression</strong> uses the inverse cumulative
distribution function of the standard normal distribution as its link.
It’s particularly useful when you believe the underlying latent process
follows a normal distribution (common in psychology and economics). The
probit and logit models often give similar results, but probit is
sometimes preferred for theoretical reasons, ease of interpretation, or
just convention of the area in which it is used.</p>
<p><strong>Complementary Log-Log (Cloglog)</strong> is designed for
situations where one outcome is much rarer than the other, or when the
data arise from a survival or time-to-event process measured in discrete
time intervals.</p>
<p>In R, you can specify these alternatives using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Logistic regression (default)
glm(y ~ x, data = mydata, family = binomial(link = &quot;logit&quot;))

# Probit regression
glm(y ~ x, data = mydata, family = binomial(link = &quot;probit&quot;))

# Complementary log-log
glm(y ~ x, data = mydata, family = binomial(link = &quot;cloglog&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>For this tutorial, we’ll stick with logistic regression as it’s the
most widely used and its coefficients have an intuitive interpretation
in terms of odds ratios.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-logistic-regression" class="section level2">
<h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>In this lesson you’ll learn about using logistic regression, a
generalized linear model (GLM), to predict a binary outcome and classify
observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-what-is-logistic-regression" class="section level2">
<h2>What is logistic regression?</h2>
<p>Thus far, we have only built models for a numeric response
variable.</p>
<div id="section-a-categorical-response-variable"
class="section level3">
<h3>A categorical response variable</h3>
<p>A well-known Stanford University study on heart transplants tracked
the five-year survival rate of patients with dire heart ailments. The
purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of heart transplants,
but for right now we will simply focus on modeling the survival rates of
these patients. This plot illustrates how those patients who were older
when the study began were more likely to be dead when the study ended
(five years later).</p>
<p>Note that we have used the <code>geom_jitter()</code> function to
create the illusion of separation in our data. Because the y value is
categorical, all of the points would either lie exactly on “dead” or
“alive”, making the individual points hard to see. To counteract this,
<code>geom_jitter()</code> will move the points a small random amount up
or down.</p>
<p>If you fit a regression line to these data, what would it look
like?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = heart_transplant, aes(x = age, y = survived)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.5)</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-logistic_files/figure-html/heart-age-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-making-a-binary-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>Making a binary variable</h3>
<p>First, we have a technical problem, in that the levels of our
response variable are labels, and you can’t build a regression model to
a variable that consists of words! We can get around this by creating a
new variable that is binary (either 0 or 1), based on whether the
patient <code>survived</code> to the end of the study. We call this new
variable <code>is_alive</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heart_transplant &lt;- heart_transplant |&gt;
  mutate(is_alive = ifelse(survived == &quot;alive&quot;, 1, 0))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-visualizing-a-binary-response" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualizing a binary response</h3>
<p>We can then visualize our <code>data_space</code>. The vertical axis
can now be thought of as the probability of being alive at the end of
the study, given one’s age at the beginning.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_space &lt;- ggplot(data = heart_transplant, aes(x = age, y = is_alive)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.5)
data_space</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-logistic_files/figure-html/heart-data-space-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-regression-with-a-binary-response"
class="section level3">
<h3>Regression with a binary response</h3>
<p>Now there is nothing preventing us from fitting a simple linear
regression model to these data, and in fact, in certain cases this may
be an appropriate thing to do.</p>
<p>But it’s not hard to see that the line doesn’t fit very well. There
are other problems as well…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_space +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-logistic_files/figure-html/heart-lm-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-limitations-of-regression" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations of regression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Could make nonsensical predictions</li>
<li>Binary response problematic</li>
</ul>
<p>What would this model predict as the probability of a 70-year-old
patient being alive? It would be a number less than zero, which doesn’t
make sense as a probability. Because the regression line always extends
to infinity in either direction, it will make predictions that are not
between 0 and 1, sometimes even for reasonable values of the explanatory
variable.</p>
<p>Second, the variability in a binary response may violate a number of
other assumptions that we make when we do inference in multiple
regression. You’ll learn about those assumptions in the tutorial on
inference for regression.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-generalized-linear-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Generalized linear models</h3>
<p>Thankfully, a modeling framework exists that generalizes regression
to include response variables that are non-normally distributed. This
family is called <strong>generalized linear models</strong> or GLMs for
short. One member of the family of GLMs is called <strong>logistic
regression</strong>, and this is the one that models a binary response
variable.</p>
<p>A full treatment of GLMs is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but
the basic idea is that you apply a so-called link function to
appropriately transform the scale of the response variable to match the
output of a linear model. The link function used by logistic regression
is the <strong>logit</strong> function. This constrains the fitted
values of the model to always lie between 0 and 1, as a valid
probability must.</p>

<h3>Fitting a GLM</h3>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:  glm(formula = is_alive ~ age, family = binomial, data = heart_transplant)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)          age  
##     1.56438     -0.05847

<pre><code>##

## Link function: logit</code></pre>
<p>Fitting a GLM in R requires only two small changes from fitting a
regression model using <code>lm()</code>. First, the function is called
<code>glm()</code> instead of <code>lm()</code>. Second, we have to
specify which kind of GLM we want using the family argument.</p>
<p>For logistic regression, we specify the <code>binomial</code> family,
which uses the logit link function.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-fitting-a-line-to-a-binary-response"
class="section level3">
<h3>Fitting a line to a binary response</h3>
<p>When our response variable is binary, a regression model has several
limitations. Among the more obvious - and logically incongruous - is
that the regression <em>line</em> extends infinitely in either
direction. This means that even though our response variable <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> only takes on the values 0 and 1, our
fitted values <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> can range
anywhere from <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. This doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>To see this in action, we’ll fit a linear regression model to data
about 55 students who applied to medical school. We want to understand
how their undergraduate <span class="math inline">\(GPA\)</span> relates
to the probability they will be accepted by a particular school <span
class="math inline">\((Acceptance)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The medical school acceptance data is loaded as
<code>MedGPA</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a scatterplot called <code>data_space</code> for
<code>Acceptance</code> as a function of <code>GPA</code>. Use
<code>geom_jitter()</code> to apply a small amount of jitter to the
points in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-direction by
setting <code>width = 0</code> and <code>height = 0.05</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>geom_smooth()</code> to add the simple linear regression
line to <code>data_space</code>.</li>

class="section level3">
<h3>Fitting a line to a binary response (2)</h3>
<p>In the previous exercise, we identified a major limitation to fitting
a linear regression model when we have a binary response variable.
However, it is not <em>always</em> inappropriate to do so. Note that our
regression line only makes illogical predictions (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{y} \lt 0\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{y} \gt 1\)</span>) for students with very
high or very low GPAs. For GPAs closer to average, the predictions seem
fine.</p>
<p>Moreover, the alternative logistic regression model - which we will
fit next - is very similar to the linear regression model for
observations near the average of the explanatory variable. It just so
happens that the logistic curve is very straight near its middle. Thus,
in these cases a linear regression model may still be acceptable, even
for a binary response.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>filter()</code> to find the subset of the observations in
<code>MedGPA</code> whose GPAs are between 3.375 and 3.77,
<em>inclusive</em>.</li>
<li>Create a scatterplot called <code>data_space</code> for
<code>Acceptance</code> as a function of <code>GPA</code> for only those
observations. Use <code>geom_jitter()</code> to apply <code>0.05</code>
jitter to the points in the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-direction and no jitter to the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> direction.</li>
<li>Use <code>geom_smooth()</code> to add only the simple linear
regression line to <code>data_space</code>.</li>

<h3>Fitting a model</h3>
<p>Logistic regression is a special case of a broader class of
generalized linear models, often known as GLMs. Specifying a logistic
regression model is very similar to specify a regression model, with two
important differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use the <code>glm()</code> function instead of
<code>lm()</code></li>
<li>We specify the <code>family</code> argument and set it to
<code>binomial</code>. This tells the GLM function that we want to fit a
logistic regression model to our binary response. The terminology stems
from the assumption that our binary response follows a what is called a
binomial distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>We still use the <code>formula</code> and <code>data</code> arguments
with <code>glm()</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the mathematical model is now: <span
class="math display">\[
    \log{ \left( \frac{y}{1-y} \right) } = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x +
\epsilon \,,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is the
error term.</p>

noticeably at the ends. The red logistic regression line will never
reach 0 or 1, eliminating those invalid predicted probabilities. In this
case, for most ages, the simple linear regression line and the logistic
regression line don’t differ by very much, and you might not lose much
by using the simpler regression model. But for older people, the
logistic model should perform much better.</p>
<p>How can we visually assess how well the logistic model fits the data?
Since the actual observations are all at 0 or 1, but our predictions are
always between 0 and 1, we will always be off by some amount. In
particular, our model predicts a 50% chance of survival for patients
that are about 27 years old. Is that accurate?</p>

<p>One way to address this question is to separate the observations into
bins based on age, and then compute the average probability of being
alive for each age group. Here, we separate the data into seven bins
such that each bin contains roughly the same number of observations. The
choice of how to define the bins is somewhat arbitrary, but this choice
seems to provide us with a reasonable picture of what is happening. In
general, it seems clear that the probability of being alive declines
with age.</p>

<h3>Adding the model to the binned plot</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>mod_heart &lt;- glm(is_alive ~ age, data = heart_transplant, family = binomial)

data_binned_space + 
  geom_line(
    data = augment(mod_heart, type.predict = &quot;response&quot;),

<p>To add our model to the plot, we’ll employ the same technique that we
used for the parallel slopes models. First, we use the
<code>augment()</code> function from the broom package to compute the
fitted values for our original observations based on our model. Note
that we have set the <code>type.predict</code> argument to ensure that
the fitted values are on the same scale as the response variable.
Second, we use the <code>geom_line()</code> function to draw a blue line
through these points.</p>
<p>This blue line is the same as the one we drew previously using
<code>geom_smooth()</code>. With the binned observations in red, we can
now see how the blue logistic regression line fits “through” these
binned points.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-using-geom_smooth-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Using <code>geom_smooth()</code></h3>
<p>Our logistic regression model can be visualized in the data space by
overlaying the appropriate logistic curve. We can use the
<code>geom_smooth()</code> function to do this. Recall that
<code>geom_smooth()</code> takes a <code>method</code> argument that
allows you to specify what type of smoother you want to see. In our
case, we need to specify that we want to use the <code>glm()</code>
function to do the smoothing.</p>
<p>However we also need to tell the <code>glm()</code> function which
member of the GLM family we want to use. To do this, we will pass the
<code>family</code> argument to <code>glm()</code> as a list using the
<code>method.args</code> argument to <code>geom_smooth()</code>. This
mechanism is common in R, and allows one function to pass a list of
arguments to another function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a scatterplot called <code>data_space</code> for
<code>Acceptance</code> as a function of <code>GPA</code>. Use
<code>geom_jitter()</code> to apply a small amount of jitter to the
points in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-direction. Set
<code>width = 0</code> and <code>height = 0.05</code> in
<code>geom_jitter()</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>geom_smooth()</code> to add the logistic regression line
to <code>data_space</code> by specifying the <code>method</code> and
<code>method.args</code> arguments to fit a logistic
<code>glm</code>.</li>

<h3>Using bins</h3>
<p>One of the difficulties in working with a binary response variable is
understanding how it “changes.” The response itself (<span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) is <em>either</em> 0 or 1, while the
fitted values (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span>) - which are
interpreted as probabilities - are <em>between</em> 0 and 1. But if
every medical school applicant is either admitted or not, what does it
mean to talk about the <em>probability</em> of being accepted?</p>
<p>What we’d like is a larger sample of students, so that for each GPA
value (e.g. 3.54) we had many observations (say <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>), and we could then take the average of
those <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations to arrive at
the estimated probability of acceptance. Unfortunately, since the
explanatory variable is continuous, this is hopeless - it would take an
infinite amount of data to make these estimates robust.</p>
<p>Instead, what we can do is put observations into <em>bins</em> based
on their GPA value. Within each bin, we can compute the proportion of
accepted students, and we can visualize our model as a smooth logistic
curve through those binned values.</p>
<p>We have created a <code>data.frame</code> called
<code>MedGPA_binned</code> that aggregates the original data into
separate bins for each 0.25 of GPA. It also contains the fitted values
from the logistic regression model.</p>
<p>Here we are plotting <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as a
function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, where that function
is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    y = \frac{\exp{( \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x )}}{1 + \exp(
\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x ) } \,.

school.</p>

<h2>Three scales approach to interpretation</h2>
<div id="section-probability-scale" class="section level3">
<h3>Probability scale</h3>
<p>For the Stanford heart transplant patients, we’ve observed how the
probability of survival seems to decline with age. The notion of
probability here is very intuitive: it’s easy to understand what we mean
when we say that the five-year survival rate is 75%.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{y} = \frac{\exp{( \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x )}}{1 +
\exp( \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x ) }
\]</span></p>
<p>Here, we compute the fitted probabilities using the
<code>augment()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heart_transplant_plus &lt;- mod_heart |&gt;
  augment(type.predict = &quot;response&quot;) |&gt;
  mutate(y_hat = .fitted)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-probability-scale-plot" class="section level3">
<h3>Probability scale plot</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, since our model is now non-linear, it’s harder to
succinctly characterize how those probabilities decline.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(heart_transplant_plus, aes(x = age, y = y_hat)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_y_continuous(&quot;Probability of being alive&quot;, limits = c(0, 1))</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-logistic_files/figure-html/heart-glm-prob-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can no longer say that “each additional year of age is associated
with a particular change in the probability of surviving,” because that
change in probability is not constant across ages. Thus, while the
probability scale is natural, it can be cumbersome to work with.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-odds-scale" class="section level3">
<h3>Odds scale</h3>
<p>To combat the problem of the scale of the y variable, we can change
the scale of the variable on the y-axis. Instead of thinking about the
probability of survival, we can think about the odds. While these two
concepts are often conflated, they are not the same. They are however,
related by the simple formula below. The <strong>odds</strong> of a
binary event are the ratio of how often it happens, to how often it
doesn’t happen.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
odds(\hat{y}) = \frac{\hat{y}}{1-\hat{y}} = \exp{( \hat{\beta}_0 +
\hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x ) }
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, if the probability of survival is 75%, then the odds of
survival are 3:1, since you are three times more likely to survive than
you are to die. Odds are commonly used to express uncertainty in a
variety of contexts, most notably gambling.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>heart_transplant_plus &lt;- heart_transplant_plus |&gt;
  mutate(odds_hat = y_hat / (1 - y_hat))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-odds-scale-plot" class="section level3">
<h3>Odds scale plot</h3>

<p><img src="ims-logistic_files/figure-html/heart-glm-odds-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>If we change the y-scale to odds, then our model must change shape as
well. In fact, our model now has the form of an exponential function. In
this case, the odds of survival decrease exponentially as people
age.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-log-odds-scale" class="section level3">
<h3>Log-odds scale</h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[
logit(\hat{y}) = \log{ \left[ \frac{\hat{y}}{1-\hat{y}} \right] } =
\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x
\]</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>heart_transplant_plus &lt;- heart_transplant_plus |&gt;
  mutate(log_odds_hat = log(odds_hat))</code></pre>
<p>While the odds scale is more useful than the probability scale for
certain things, it isn’t entirely satisfying. Statisticians also think
about logistic regression models on the log-odds scale, which is formed
by taking the <strong>natural log</strong> of the odds.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-log-odds-plot" class="section level3">

<p><img src="ims-logistic_files/figure-html/heart-glm-log-odds-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The benefit to this approach is clear: now the logistic regression
model can be visualized as a line!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, understanding what the log of the odds of an event
means is very difficult for humans.</p>

<p>So we’ve identified three different scales when working with logistic
regression models. Each has its own strengths but also weaknesses, and
so you really can’t stick with one scale and ignore the others.</p>
<p>The probability scale is the easiest to understand, but it makes the
logistic function difficult to interpret. Conversely the logistic
function becomes a line on the log-odds scale. This makes the function
easy to interpret, but the log of the odds is hard to grapple with. The
odds scale lies somewhere in between.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-odds-ratios" class="section level3">
<h3>Odds ratios</h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[
OR = \frac{ odds(\hat{y} | x + 1 )}{odds(\hat{y} | x )}
  = \frac{ \exp{( \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot (x + 1) )
}}{\exp{( \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x ) }}
  = \exp{\beta_1}
\]</span></p>
<pre><code>## (Intercept)         age 
##   4.7797050   0.9432099</code></pre>
<p>Moreover, it is the odds scale that leads to the most common
interpretation of the coefficients in a logistic regression model. As
noted previously, interpreting the coefficients on the probability scale
is hard because the model is non-linear, while interpreting them on the
log-odds scale is hard because the scale is abstruse. However, on the
odds scale we can form the ratio of the odds when the explanatory
variable increases by one unit. This works out mathematically to be
equal to the exponential of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(e^{\beta_{1}}\)</span>, the “slope”
coefficient.</p>
<p>Our interest is in how this number differs from 1. If it’s greater
than one, then the odds increase. Conversely, if it’s less than one,
then the odds decrease. In our case, our model suggests that each
additional year of age is associated with a 6% decrease in the odds of
survival.</p>
<p>Keeping careful track of which scale you are working on will help you
get these interpretations right.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-odds-scale-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Odds scale</h3>
<p>For most people, the idea that we could estimate the probability of
being admitted to medical school based on undergraduate GPA is fairly
intuitive. However, thinking about how the probability changes as a
function of GPA is complicated by the non-linear logistic curve. By
translating the response from the probability scale to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds">odds</a> scale, we make the
right hand side of our equation easier to understand.</p>
<p>If the probability of getting accepted is <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then the odds are <span
class="math inline">\(y / (1-y)\)</span>. Expressions of probabilities
in terms of odds are common in many situations, perhaps most notably
gambling.</p>
<p>Here we are plotting <span class="math inline">\(y/(1-y)\)</span> as
a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, where that
function is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
odds(\hat{y}) = \frac{\hat{y}}{1-\hat{y}} = \exp{( \hat{\beta}_0 +
\hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x ) }
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the left hand side is the expected <em>odds</em> of being
accepted to medical school. The right hand side is now a familiar
exponential function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Already loaded for you are two data frames: the

<h3>Log-odds scale</h3>
<p>Previously, we considered two formulations of logistic regression
models:</p>
<ul>
<li>on the probability scale, the units are easy to interpret, but the
function is non-linear, which makes it hard to understand</li>
<li>on the odds scale, the units are harder (but not impossible) to
interpret, and the function in exponential, which makes it harder (but
not impossible) to interpret</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll now add a third formulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>on the log-odds scale, the units are nearly impossible to interpret,
but the function is linear, which makes it easy to understand</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, none of these three is uniformly superior. Most
people tend to interpret the fitted values on the probability scale and
the function on the log-odds scale. The interpretation of the
coefficients is most commonly done on the odds scale. Recall that we
interpreted our slope coefficient <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> in <em>linear</em> regression as
the expected change in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> given a
one unit change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. On the
probability scale, the function is non-linear and so this approach won’t
work. On the log-odds scale, the function is linear, but the units are
not interpretable (it is difficult to answer the question: what does the
<span class="math inline">\(\log\)</span> of the odds mean??). However,
on the odds scale, a one unit change in <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> leads to the odds being multiplied by a
factor of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>. To see why, we
form the <strong>odds ratio</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    OR = \frac{odds(\hat{y} | x + 1 )}{ odds(\hat{y} | x )} =
\exp{\beta_1}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the exponentiated coefficient <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> tells us how the expected
<em>odds</em> change for a one unit increase in the explanatory
variable. It is tempting to interpret this as a change in the expected
<em>probability</em>, but this is wrong and can lead to nonsensical
predictions (e.g. expected probabilities greater than 1).</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a variable called <code>log_odds</code> to
<code>MedGPA_binned</code> that records the odds of being accepted for
each bin. Recall that <span class="math inline">\(odds(p) = p /
(1-p)\)</span>.<br />

<li>Create a scatterplot called <code>data_space</code> for

<h3>Interpretation of logistic regression</h3>
<p>The fitted coefficient <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span> from the medical school
logistic regression model is 5.45. The exponential of this is
233.73.</p>
<p>Donald’s GPA is 2.9, and thus the model predicts that the probability
of him getting into medical school is 3.26%. The odds of Donald getting
into medical school are 0.0337, or - phrased in gambling terms -
29.6:1.</p>
<p><strong>Food for thought:</strong> If Donald hacks the school’s
registrar and changes his GPA to 3.9, how would his expected odds of
getting into medical school change?</p>

<h3>Learning from a model</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>mod &lt;- glm(is_alive ~ age + transplant, 
                    data = heart_transplant, family = binomial)

exp(coef(mod))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         (Intercept)                 age transplanttreatment 
##           2.6461676           0.9265153           6.1914009</code></pre>
<p>One important reason to build a model is to learn from the
coefficients about the underlying random process. For example, in the
Stanford heart transplant study, we were able to estimate the effect of
age on the five-year survival rate. This simple model shed no light on
the obvious purpose of the study, which was to determine whether those
patients who received heart transplants were likely to live longer than
the control group that received no transplant.</p>
<p>By including the transplant variable in our model and exponentiating
the coefficients, we see a huge effect. Patients who received a heart
transplant saw their odds of survival improve by a factor of 6.2, even
after controlling for age. Note that as expected, age still has a
deleterious effect on mortality.</p>

<p>As we have seen, running the augment() function on the model object
will return a data frame with—among other things—the fitted values.
However, when we run this with the default options, the fitted values
sure don’t look like probabilities! These are the fitted values on the
log-odds scale, which aren’t terribly useful to us.</p>

<p>However, if we set the <code>type.predict</code> argument to
“response”, we retrieve the fitted values on the familiar probability
scale.</p>
<p>Making predictions about the probability of survival for those
patients who took part in the study is of somewhat limited value. We
already know whether they survived! Aside from learning about the
efficacy of the treatment, another common purpose for modeling is to
make predictions for observations that are not part of our data set.
These are called <strong>out-of-sample</strong> predictions.</p>

<h3>Dick Cheney</h3>

<p>For example, former Vice President Dick Cheney famously received a
heart transplant in March of 2012 at the age of 71. More than five years
later, Cheney is still alive, but what does our model predict for his
five-year survival rate?</p>

<p>To compute this, we build a data frame with Cheney’s data, and run it
through our model using the newdata argument to <code>augment()</code>.
The results suggest that Cheney had only a 6.8% chance of survival.
Either Cheney is quite lucky to be alive, or—more likely—the survival
rates of all heart transplant patients have improved considerably since
the Stanford study was completed in 1973.</p>

<p>If our response variable is binary, then why are we making
probabilistic predictions? Shouldn’t we be able to make binary
predictions? That is, instead of predicting the probability that a
person survives for five years, shouldn’t we be able to predict
definitively whether they will live or die?</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways in which we could reasonably
convert our probabilistic fitted values into a binary decision. The
simplest way would be to simply round the probabilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-confusion-matrix" class="section level3">
<h3>Confusion matrix</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>mod_plus |&gt;
  select(is_alive, alive_hat) |&gt;

<pre><code>##         alive_hat
## is_alive  0  1
##        0 71  4
##        1 20  8</code></pre>
<p>So how well did our model perform? One common way of assessing
performance of models for a categorical response is via a
<strong>confusion matrix</strong>. This cross-tabulates the actual
outcomes with our model’s predictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>True Negatives (71)</strong>: Correctly predicted death</li>
<li><strong>False Positives (20)</strong>: Predicted alive but actually
died<br />
</li>
<li><strong>False Negatives (4)</strong>: Predicted death but actually
alive</li>
<li><strong>True Positives (8)</strong>: Correctly predicted
survival</li>
</ul>
<p>Our overall accuracy was 79 out of 103, or about
<strong>77%</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that our model predicted only 12 patients would live, but more
than twice as many patients actually survived. Our model’s
under-prediction is probably a consequence of the low survival rate
overall, coupled with our clumsy rounding scheme. One way to improve the
accuracy of our binary predictions would be to experiment with looser
rounding thresholds.</p>

<div id="section-making-probabilistic-predictions-1"

<h3>Making probabilistic predictions</h3>
<p>Just as we did with linear regression, we can use our logistic
regression model to make predictions about new observations. In this
exercise, we will use the <code>newdata</code> argument to the
<code>augment()</code> function from the <strong>broom</strong> package
to make predictions about students who were not in our original data
set. These predictions are sometimes called <em>out-of-sample</em>.</p>
<p>Following our previous discussion about scales, with logistic
regression it is important that we specify on which scale we want the
predicted values. Although the default is <code>terms</code> – which
uses the log-odds scale – we want our predictions on the probability
scale, which is the scale of the <code>response</code> variable. The
<code>type.predict</code> argument to <code>augment()</code> controls
this behaviour.</p>
<p>A logistic regression model object, <code>mod</code>, has been
defined for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new data frame which has one variable called
<code>GPA</code> and one row, with the value 3.51.</li>
<li>Use <code>augment()</code> to find the expected probability of

<h3>Making binary predictions</h3>
<p>Naturally, we want to know how well our model works. Did it predict
acceptance for the students who were actually accepted to medical
school? Did it predict rejections for the student who were not admitted?
These types of predictions are called <em>in-sample</em>. One common way
to evaluate models with a binary response is with a confusion matrix.
[Yes, that is actually what it is called!]</p>
<p>However, note that while our response variable is binary, our fitted
values are probabilities. Thus, we have to round them somehow into
binary predictions. While the probabilities convey more information, we
might ultimately have to make a decision, and so this rounding is common
in practice. There are many different ways to round, but for simplicity
we will predict admission if the fitted probability is greater than 0.5,
and rejection otherwise.</p>
<p>First, we’ll use <code>augment()</code> to make the predictions, and
then <code>mutate()</code> and <code>round()</code> to convert these
probabilities into binary decisions. Then we will form the confusion
matrix using the <code>table()</code> function. <code>table()</code>
will compute a 2-way table when given a data frame with two categorical
variables, so we will first use <code>select()</code> to grab only those
variables.</p>
<p>You will find that this model made only 15 mistakes on these 55
observations, so it is nearly 73% accurate.</p>
<p>The model object <code>mod</code> is already loaded for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a data frame with the actual observations, and their fitted
probabilities, and add a new column, <code>Acceptance_hat</code>, with
the <em>binary</em> decision by rounding the fitted probabilities.</li>
<li>Compute the confusion matrix between the actual and predicted
acceptance.</li>

<h2>Advanced Topics: Marginal Effects and Non-Collapsibility</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve focused on interpreting odds ratios from logistic
regression models. However, there are some important nuances about these
effects that you should be aware of as you advance in your statistical
practice.</p>
<div id="section-the-problem-of-non-collapsibility"
class="section level3">
<h3>The Problem of Non-Collapsibility</h3>
<p>One surprising property of odds ratios is that they are
<strong>non-collapsible</strong>. The <strong>non-collapsibility of the
odds ratio (OR)</strong> is a mathematical property where the crude
(unadjusted) odds ratio for a population does not equal the weighted
average of the odds ratios within specific strata of a confounding
variable, even when there is no actual confounding.</p>
<p>This occurs because the odds ratio reflects the non-linear
relationship between odds and probabilities, which means the OR can
change based on the distribution of the risk factors in the population.
This phenomenon can lead to different ORs when adjusting for covariates,
making the OR less portable across populations with varying baseline
risk.</p>
<div id="section-a-concrete-example" class="section level4">
<h4>A Concrete Example</h4>
<p>To really understand non-collapsibility, let’s work through a simple
example. Imagine a clinical trial with 4000 patients testing two
treatments (A vs B) for a binary outcome. The trial has equal numbers of
males and females, and sex is a strong risk factor (but is perfectly
balanced across treatment groups—so there’s no confounding).</p>
<p><strong>Within males only:</strong> - Treatment A: 500 with Y=1 out
of 1000 patients - Treatment B: 100 with Y=1 out of 1000 patients<br />
- <strong>Odds Ratio (A vs B) = 9.0</strong></p>
<p><strong>Within females only:</strong> - Treatment A: 900 with Y=1 out
of 1000 patients - Treatment B: 500 with Y=1 out of 1000 patients -
<strong>Odds Ratio (A vs B) = 9.0</strong></p>
<p>So the treatment effect is identical (OR = 9) for both males and
females. There is no treatment-by-sex interaction.</p>
<p><strong>But what happens when we ignore sex and just look at the
pooled data?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pooled (ignoring sex):</strong> - Treatment A: 1400 with Y=1
out of 2000 patients - Treatment B: 600 with Y=1 out of 2000 patients -
<strong>Odds Ratio (A vs B) = 5.44</strong></p>
<p>Wait… what? The odds ratio went from 9.0 (in both subgroups) to 5.44
(in the pooled data)! And note that 5.44 is <strong>not</strong> a
weighted average of 9 and 9. <em>This is non-collapsibility in
action</em>!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Let&#39;s verify this with our heart transplant data
# Simple model: only transplant status (marginal/unadjusted)
mod_marginal &lt;- glm(is_alive ~ transplant, 
                    data = heart_transplant, family = binomial)

# Adjusted model: transplant + age (conditional)
mod_conditional &lt;- glm(is_alive ~ transplant + age, 
                       data = heart_transplant, family = binomial)

# Compare the transplant effect
exp(coef(mod_marginal)[&quot;transplanttreatment&quot;])  # Marginal OR</code></pre>
<pre><code>## transplanttreatment 
##                   4</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>exp(coef(mod_conditional)[&quot;transplanttreatment&quot;])  # Conditional OR</code></pre>
<pre><code>## transplanttreatment 
##            6.191401</code></pre>
<p>The odds ratio for transplant changes when we adjust for age, even
though age and transplant status might be completely unrelated (no
confounding). This is a mathematical property of odds ratios, not
evidence of confounding.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-why-does-the-unadjusted-or-not-generalize"
class="section level4">
<h4>Why Does the Unadjusted OR Not Generalize?</h4>
<p>Here’s the key insight: <strong>The unadjusted (marginal) OR of 5.44
doesn’t apply to males, doesn’t apply to females, and doesn’t generalize
to other populations!</strong></p>
<p>If we took our trial results to a different clinical population with
a different sex distribution, the marginal OR would change! Let’s see
what happens if we apply our results to populations with different
proportions of females:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Proportion Female</th>
<th>Marginal OR</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>50% (original)</td>
<td>5.44</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>80%</td>
<td>6.43</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>60%</td>
<td>6.03</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td>5.00</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>20%</td>
<td>3.94</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>10%</td>
<td>3.38</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The marginal OR changes dramatically based on the sex composition of
the population, even though the true treatment effect (OR = 9) is the
same for everyone!</p>
<p>In contrast, the <strong>conditional OR of 9.0 remains
constant</strong> regardless of the population’s sex distribution. It
generalizes because it describes the treatment effect for a specific
type of patient (male or female), not an average over an arbitrary
mix.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-what-does-the-marginal-or-mean" class="section level4">
<h4>What Does the Marginal OR Mean?</h4>
<p>The unadjusted OR of 5.44 applies only to a population with exactly
50% females and 50% males—because that’s how our sample was constituted.
It would apply to an individual patient only if we somehow didn’t know
the patient’s sex and believed there was exactly a 50% chance they were
female.</p>
<p>But in clinical practice, we treat individuals, not populations. When
counseling a specific patient, we know their sex (and other risk
factors). The conditional OR of 9.0 tells us about the treatment effect
for <em>that specific patient</em>, while the marginal OR of 5.44 tells
us about an average over a specific population mix that may not match
our patient.</p>
<p>This non-collapsibility means that odds ratios can vary across
populations with different baseline risk profiles, making unadjusted ORs
less comparable across studies or populations with different risk factor
distributions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-conditional-vs.-marginal-effects"
class="section level3">
<h3>Conditional vs. Marginal Effects</h3>
<p>Understanding non-collapsibility leads us to an important
distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conditional effects</strong> (what logistic regression
coefficients give us): The effect of a predictor at the reference level
of all other predictors in the model. When we exponentiate coefficients
to get odds ratios, we’re describing effects for a specific subgroup
defined by the other covariates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Marginal effects</strong>: The population-average effect
of a predictor, averaging over the actual distribution of other
variables in your data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The key choice</strong>: Do you want to know the effect at a
specific set of covariate values (conditional), or the average effect
across your population (marginal)?</p>
<p>For linear regression, these two types of effects are the same — this
is what we call <strong>collapsibility</strong>. But for logistic
regression (and most other GLMs), they differ because of the non-linear
link function.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-why-does-this-matter" class="section level3">
<h3>Why Does This Matter?</h3>
<p>Understanding this distinction is crucial for proper
interpretation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Portability across populations</strong>: Because conditional
odds ratios depend on the baseline risk distribution, they may not
generalize well to populations with different risk profiles</li>
<li><strong>When comparing studies</strong>: If two studies use
different sets of control variables or have different baseline risks,
their odds ratios aren’t directly comparable</li>
<li><strong>For policy questions</strong>: “What is the average effect
in the population?” is answered by marginal effects, not conditional

<h3>The marginaleffects Package</h3>
<p>The <strong>marginaleffects</strong> package provides tools to
compute marginal effects, average predictions, and other quantities that
are often more interpretable than raw coefficients.</p>
<p>Let’s explore some of its key functions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load the package (you may need to install it first)

<p>The <code>avg_slopes()</code> function computes the <strong>average
marginal effect</strong> for each predictor. This tells us: on average
across all patients in our sample, how much does a one-unit increase in
age change the probability of survival? This is a population-average
effect, not a conditional effect at reference levels. Also note, that
<code>marginaleffects</code> automatically puts it on the response scale
(probabilities), which is often easier to interpret.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-comparing-predictions-at-different-values"
class="section level3">
<h3>Comparing Predictions at Different Values</h3>
<p>We can also compare predicted probabilities at different covariate
values:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Compare predictions for treatment vs. control, averaging over age distribution
predictions(mod, newdata = datagrid(transplant = c(&quot;control&quot;, &quot;treatment&quot;)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

## 
## Type: invlink(link)</code></pre>
<p>This shows us the average predicted probability of survival for the
control and treatment groups, averaging over the distribution of ages in
our data. This gives us the marginal probability for each transplant
group.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-average-treatment-effect" class="section level3">
<h3>Average Treatment Effect</h3>
<p>We can compute the average treatment effect directly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Average treatment effect (difference in probabilities)
avg_comparisons(mod, variables = &quot;transplant&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(&gt;|z|)    S 2.5 % 97.5 %

## 
## Term: transplant
## Type: response
## Comparison: treatment - control</code></pre>
<p>This tells us that, on average across the population, receiving a
heart transplant increases the probability of 5-year survival by
approximately X percentage points.</p>
<p>Compare this marginal effect (a probability difference, averaged
across the population) to the conditional odds ratio we computed earlier
(which applies at the reference level of age). Both are valid, but they
answer different questions!</p>
<p>We can also calculate the average marginal effect of transplant in
terms of the ATE in terms of the odds ratio or the risk ratio. It is
important to remember that the odds ratio is non-collapsible, so this
average odds ratio will not equal the conditional odds ratio from the
model coefficients!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Average treatment effect (odds ratio)
avg_comparisons(mod, variables = &quot;transplant&quot;,

<h3>Marginal Effects at Specific Values</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to know the effect at a specific, meaningful value
of the covariates (a conditional effect, but expressed as a probability
change rather than an odds ratio):</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Marginal effect of age for a 50-year-old in the treatment group
slopes(mod, newdata = datagrid(age = 50, transplant = &quot;treatment&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

## 
## Type: response</code></pre>
<p>This tells us: for a 50-year-old patient who received a transplant
(conditional on these covariate values), how much does an additional
year of age change their probability of survival?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-visualizing-marginal-effects" class="section level3">
<h3>Visualizing Marginal Effects</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful features of the marginaleffects package is
visualization:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Plot predicted probabilities across the range of age, by transplant status
plot_predictions(mod, condition = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;transplant&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-logistic_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This creates a plot showing how the predicted probability of survival
changes with age, separately for the treatment and control groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-when-to-use-each-approach" class="section level3">
<h3>When to Use Each Approach</h3>
<p><strong>Use conditional effects (regression coefficients/odds ratios)
when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You want to describe effects at the <em>reference</em> level of
other covariates</li>
<li>You want effects that are constant on the log-odds scale</li>
<li>You’re interested in individual-level predictions for people with
specific covariate profiles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use marginal effects when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You want population-average effects (or at specific values of the
covariates)</li>
<li>You need to communicate results to a non-technical audience
(probabilities are easier to understand than odds ratios)</li>
<li>You’re comparing effects across studies with different populations
or covariate adjustment</li>
<li>You want effects that are more portable across populations with
different baseline risk distributions</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-practice-with-marginal-effects" class="section level3">
<h3>Practice with Marginal Effects</h3>
<p>Let’s practice using the marginaleffects package with the medical
school admissions data.</p>
<p>The model <code>mod</code> predicting medical school acceptance from
GPA has been created for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>avg_slopes()</code> to compute the average marginal effect
of GPA</li>

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-interpreting-the-results" class="section level3">
<h3>Interpreting the Results</h3>
<p>When you run <code>avg_slopes(mod)</code>, you should see that the
average marginal effect of GPA is approximately 0.94 (this may vary
slightly depending on your data). This means that, on average across the
population, a one-point increase in GPA is associated with about a 94
percentage point increase in the probability of acceptance to medical
school.</p>
<p>Compare this to the odds ratio interpretation we used earlier! The
odds ratio tells us about multiplicative changes in odds at the
reference level, while the marginal effect tells us about additive
changes in probability averaged across the population. Both are correct,
but they answer different questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-key-takeaways" class="section level3">
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Odds ratios are non-collapsible</strong>: They change when
you add or remove variables from the model, even when those variables
are unrelated to the predictor of interest. This is a mathematical
property, not evidence of confounding.</li>
<li><strong>Non-collapsibility affects portability</strong>: Odds ratios
may not generalize well across populations with different baseline risk
distributions</li>
<li><strong>Conditional vs. marginal</strong>: The choice between
conditional effects (regression coefficients at reference levels) and
marginal effects (population averages) depends on whether you want to
describe effects for specific covariate profiles or average effects
across your population</li>
<li><strong>The marginaleffects package</strong> provides tools to
compute and visualize marginal effects and can make results more
interpretable</li>
<li><strong>Both approaches are valid</strong>: Choose based on your
research question, audience, and whether you need population averages or
effects at specific covariate values</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these concepts will make you a more sophisticated
consumer and producer of logistic regression analyses!</p>
