<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>In last week’s online activity, you were introduced to R and how to
inspect data. In this activity, we will explore data visualization,
specifically focusing on visualizing relationships between two numeric
variables.</p>
<div id="section-why-visualize-relationships" class="section level3">
<h3>Why visualize relationships?</h3>
<p>Understanding how two variables relate to each other is fundamental
to data analysis. For example, we might want to know: - Does a possum’s
tail length relate to its body length? - Do babies with longer gestation
periods tend to weigh more at birth? - Is there a relationship between a
baseball player’s on-base percentage and slugging percentage?</p>
<p>Scatterplots help us answer these questions visually!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-learning-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create scatterplots using <code>ggplot2</code> to visualize
relationships between two numeric variables</li>
<li>Identify and label response (y) and explanatory (x) variables
appropriately</li>
<li>Characterize relationships by their form, direction, strength, and
outliers</li>
<li>Apply transformations to reveal hidden patterns in data</li>
<li>Handle overplotting using transparency and jittering techniques</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-visualizing-two-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualizing two variables</h2>
<p>In particular, in these tutorials you will learn techniques for
characterizing and quantifying the relationship between two numeric
variables.</p>
<p>In a statistical model, we generally have one variable that is the
output and one or more variables that are the inputs. We will refer to
the output variable as the response and we will denote it with the
letter <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. In other disciplines or
contexts, you may hear this quantity called the dependent variable. More
generally, the response variable is a quantity that we think might be
related to the input or explanatory variable in some way. In other
fields, these can be called “independent” or “predictor” variables. We
typically denote any explanatory variables with the letter <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In these tutorials, we will focus on
the case of a single explanatory variable. In the next tutorials,
however, we will allow for several explanatory variables.</p>
<p>When we study relationships, we typically have:</p>
<p><strong>Response variable</strong> (what we want to understand) -
Also called: dependent variable, outcome variable - Denoted by: <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> - Plotted on: vertical (y) axis -
Example: A baby’s birth weight</p>
<p><strong>Explanatory variable</strong> (what might explain the
response) - Also called: independent variable, predictor variable -
Denoted by: <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> - Plotted on:
horizontal (x) axis - Example: Length of gestation (weeks)</p>
<ul>
<li>Both variables are (continuous) <em>numerical</em></li>
</ul>
<div id="section-graphical-representations" class="section level3">
<h3>Graphical representations</h3>
<p>Just as you learned to visualize the distribution of one variable
with a histogram or density plot, statisticians have developed a
commonly used framework for visualizing the relationship between two
numeric variables: the scatterplot. The scatterplot has been called the
most “<a
href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jhbs.20078/abstract">generally
useful invention in the history of statistical graphics</a>.” It is a
simple two-dimensional plot in which the two coordinates of each dot
represent the values of two variables measured on a single
observation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the response variable on vertical axis</li>
<li>Put the explanatory variable on horizontal axis</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="ims-two-variables_files/figure-html/2-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>By convention, we always put the response variable on the vertical,
or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis, and the explanatory
variable on the horizontal, or <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-your-first-scatterplot" class="section level3">
<h3>Your First Scatterplot</h3>
<p>Let’s look at data from possums in Australia. We’ll examine whether
tail length can help us predict total body length.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Do possums with longer tails also have
longer bodies?</p>
<p>In <code>ggplot</code>, we bind the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
aesthetics to our explanatory and response variables, and then use the
<code>geom_point()</code> function to actually draw the points. Here we
can see a scatterplot of the total length of a possum’s body as a
function of the length of its tail.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_l)) +
  geom_point()</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-two-variables_files/figure-html/3-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Note that the axes have been labeled with the names of the variables
automatically, based on the names of the variables in the dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-labeling-axes" class="section level3">
<h3>Labeling Axes</h3>
<p>For clarity, it is important to give your axes human-readable labels.
We can do that with the <code>labs()</code> function. It is a good data
visualization practice to include any necessary units in axis
labels!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_l)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = &quot;Length of Possum Tail (cm)&quot;,
       y = &quot;Length of Possum Body (cm)&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-two-variables_files/figure-html/4-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Note that the names of the axis labels must include quotations
(<code>""</code>), indicating to <code>ggplot()</code> that these are
names <strong>not</strong> variables.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-connection-to-boxplots" class="section level2">
<h2>Connection to boxplots</h2>
<p>Since you already know how a boxplot can illustrate the relationship
between a numerical response variable and a <strong>categorical</strong>
explanatory variable, it may be helpful to think of a scatterplot as a
continuous generalization of side-by-side boxplots.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can think of boxplots as scatterplots…
<ul>
<li>…but with discretized explanatory variable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <code>cut()</code> function allows for us to discretize a
continuous variable
<ul>
<li>Choose appropriate number of “boxes”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div id="section-discretizing-continuous-variables"
class="section level3">
<h3>Discretizing Continuous Variables</h3>
<p>The <code>cut()</code> function converts a continuous numeric
variable into categories (bins). Think of it like creating “groups” from
a range of numbers.</p>
<p>For example, if tail lengths range from 32 to 43 cm,
<code>cut(tail_l, breaks = 5)</code> might create groups like: - Group
1: 32-34.9 cm - Group 2: 35-37.9 cm - And so on…</p>
<p>This allows us to create boxplots for each group!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-discretized-scatterplot" class="section level3">
<h3>Discretized scatterplot</h3>
<p>We can connect these ideas by discretizing our explanatory variable.
This can be achieved in R using the <code>cut()</code> function, which
takes a numeric variable and chops it into a specified number of
discrete chunks. The <code>breaks</code> argument specifies the number
of chunks.</p>
<p>Here, we are creating a new variable named <code>tail_cut</code> from
using the <code>cut()</code> function on the original
<code>tail_l</code> variable. We are then saving this new variable back
into the original <code>possum</code> dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>possum &lt;- possum |&gt;
  mutate(tail_cut = cut(tail_l, breaks = 5))</code></pre>
<p>We can then plot the relationship between total length and the new
<code>tail_cut</code> variable. What we’ve done is gathered up all of
the data points in these bins and plotted them in a vertical line,
rather than at their original tail length value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_cut)) +
  geom_point()</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-two-variables_files/figure-html/5-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-boxplot" class="section level3">
<h3>Boxplot</h3>
<p>This type of dotplot is not standard. What is more common is to
create side-by-side boxplots of the distribution of these points. If we
change from <code>geom_point()</code> to <code>geom_boxplot()</code>, we
will get this more “standard” visualization.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_cut)) +
  geom_boxplot()</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-two-variables_files/figure-html/6-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>A notable attribute of a scatterplot is its connection to the raw
data. A boxplot, however, is wholly disconnected from the raw data, only
plotting summaries of the data. To re-forge this connection, we can
overlay the original data points on top of the boxplots, by simply
adding another layer to our <code>ggplot()</code>!</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a few parts of the code below. First, we have
added <code>alpha = 0</code> to the boxplots, so that the “outlier”
points are not plotted (we don’t want to plot them twice). The
<code>geom_jitter()</code> function instead of the
<code>geom_point()</code> function, since the points are being plotted
on top of each other. You can think of jittering as taking the
overplotted graph (where the points are overlapping) and giving it a
tiny shake. Jittering will move the points a little bit side-to-side and
up-and-down, but their position from the original plot won’t
dramatically change.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_cut)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0) +
  geom_jitter(color = &quot;sky blue&quot;, width = 0.2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="ims-two-variables_files/figure-html/boxdot-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now we can see the original data points, and the boxplots of the
different tail length groups. We can see that overall, as the median
tail length increases the body length also increases.</p>
<p>Now it’s time for you to get some practice making scatterplots.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-your-turn" class="section level2">
<h2>Your turn!</h2>
<p>Scatterplots are the most common and effective tools for visualizing
the relationship between two numeric variables.</p>
<p>The <code>ncbirths</code> dataset is a random sample of 1,000 cases
taken from a larger dataset collected in 2004. Each case describes the
birth of a single child born in North Carolina, along with various
characteristics of the child (e.g. birth weight, length of gestation,
etc.), the child’s mother (e.g. age, weight gained during pregnancy,
smoking habits, etc.) and the child’s father (e.g. age). You can view
the help file for these data by running <code>?ncbirths</code> in the
console.</p>
<p>Using the <code>ncbirths</code> dataset, use <code>ggplot()</code> to
make a scatterplot visualizing the relationship between birth weight and
length of gestation of these babies.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Boxplots as discretized/conditioned scatterplots</h3>
<p>If it is helpful, you can think of boxplots as scatterplots for which
the variable on the x-axis has been discretized.</p>
<p>The <code>cut()</code> function takes two arguments: the continuous
variable you want to discretize and the number of <code>breaks</code>
that you want to make in that continuous variable in order to discretize
it.</p>
<p>First, we will make a new variable, named <code>weeks_cut</code>,
which discretizes the original <code>weeks</code> variable. We will use
the <code>cut()</code> function, specifying four breaks.</p>
<p><strong>What you should see</strong>: A new column in your dataset
with 4 different category levels.</p>

<div id="section-characterizing-bivariate-relationships"
class="section level2">
<h2>Characterizing bivariate relationships</h2>
<p>Scatterplots can reveal characteristics of the relationship between
two variables. Any patterns–and deviations from those–we see in these
plots could give us some insight into the nature of the underlying
phenomenon. Specifically, we look for four things: form, direction,
strength, and unusual observations.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Form</strong>: What shape do the points make?
<ul>
<li>Linear (points follow a straight line)</li>
<li>Non-linear/curved (points follow a curve)</li>
<li>No pattern (points are scattered randomly)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Direction</strong>: Do variables move together or
oppositely?
<ul>
<li>Positive (both increase together: ↗)</li>
<li>Negative (one increases as other decreases: ↘)</li>
<li>No direction (no clear trend)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Strength</strong>: How closely do points follow the pattern?
<ul>
<li>Strong (points tightly clustered around pattern)</li>
<li>Moderate (some scatter but pattern visible)</li>
<li>Weak (lots of scatter, pattern barely visible)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unusual observations</strong>: Any points that don’t fit?
<ul>
<li>Outliers (far from other points)</li>
<li>Influential points (could change the pattern if removed)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<div id="section-examples-of-scatterplots" class="section level3">
<h3>Examples of scatterplots</h3>
<p>We’re going to look at a bunch of scatterplots that we found “in the
wild” and talk about what we see, so that you can start to build some
experience in interpreting them.</p>
<p>You can continue this exercise on your own by doing a Google image
search for “scatterplot.”</p>
<p>As we work through these, please keep in mind that much of what we
are doing at this stage involves making judgment calls. This is part of
the nature of statistics, and while it can be frustrating–especially as
a beginner. However, it is an inescapable part of doing statistics. For
better or for worse, statistics is not a field where there is one right
answer. There are of course an infinite number of indefensible claims,
but many judgments are open to interpretation.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-sign-legibility" class="section level3">
<h3>Sign Legibility</h3>
<p>Here we see a negative, slightly non-linear relationship between sign
legibility and driver age. This makes sense to me, since people’s
eyesight tends to get worse as they age. We would characterize the
strength of this relationship as moderately strong, since the pattern
seems to be pervasive. There doesn’t seem to be any outliers here.</p>
<p>This relationship may be a good candidate for fitting a regression
model, but the curvature in the relationship deserves attention. Indeed,
very few relationships will be truly “linear,” but it is our
responsibility to assess if it is reasonable to assume if a relationship
is linear “enough.”</p>
<p><img src="images/chp1_scat2.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-nist" class="section level3">
<h3>NIST</h3>
<p>Conversely, in this next scatterplot we see little evidence of any
relationship at all. The direction is neither positive nor negative, nor
is there any clearly identifiable form. Any perceived relationship would
be exceptionally weak.</p>
<p><img src="images/chp1_scat3.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-non-linear" class="section level3">
<h3>Non-linear</h3>
<p>In this “Example Scatter Plot” we see another clear, non-linear
relationship. In this case, the direction is negative for negative
values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, but positive for
positive values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The points
are clustered fairly close together, so the relationship is fairly
strong. The point in the upper-left-hand corner might be considered an
outlier - since it is far from the other points - but it doesn’t
represent a break from the overall pattern of the points.</p>
<p><img src="images/scatterplot.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-fan-shape" class="section level3">
<h3>Fan shape</h3>
<p>In this scatterplot, we see what is known as a “fan shape.” The
direction is certainly positive, but the spread of the points increases
dramatically as we get further from the origin. We will discuss this
type of pattern more later, but it is an indicator of “non-constant”
variance, as the variability (spread) in the y-values increases for
larger values of x. Generally, log-transformations do a great job of
“taming” these fan shapes, allowing for us to use a linear regression
model on the transformed data.</p>
<p><img src="images/plotpng.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In these next exercises, you’ll get more practice creating
scatterplots and characterizing what you see in them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-your-turn-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Your turn!</h2>
<p>Creating scatterplots is simple and they are so useful that it is
worthwhile to expose yourself to many examples. Over time, you will gain
familiarity with the types of patterns that you see. You will begin to
recognize how scatterplots can reveal the nature of the relationship
between two variables.</p>
<p>In this exercise, and throughout this lesson, we will be using
several datasets listed below. These data are available through the
<strong>openintro</strong> package.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>mammals</code> dataset contains information about 39
different species of mammals, including their body weight, brain weight,
gestation time, and a few other variables.</li>
<li>The <code>mlbbat10</code> dataset contains batting statistics for
1,199 Major League Baseball players during the 2010 season.</li>
<li>The <code>bdims</code> dataset contains body girth and skeletal
diameter measurements for 507 physically active individuals.</li>
<li>The <code>smoking</code> dataset contains information on the smoking
habits of 1,691 citizens of the United Kingdom.</li>
</ul>
<p>To see more thorough documentation on any of these datasets, use the
<code>?</code> or <code>help()</code> functions.</p>
<p>First, using the <code>mammals</code> dataset, create a scatterplot
illustrating how the brain weight (<code>brain_wt</code>) of a mammal
varies as a function of its body weight (<code>body_wt</code>).</p>

<h2>Transformations</h2>
<p>The relationship between two variables may not be linear. In these
cases we can sometimes see strange and even inscrutable patterns in a
scatterplot of the data. Sometimes there really is no meaningful
relationship between the two variables. Other times, a careful
<em>transformation</em> of one or both of the variables can reveal a
clear relationship. Please note, we will follow this in greater depth
later in this course.</p>
<p>Recall the bizarre pattern that you saw in the scatterplot between
brain weight and body weight among mammals in a previous exercise. Can
we use transformations to clarify this relationship?</p>
<p><strong>ggplot2</strong> provides several different mechanisms for
viewing transformed relationships. The <code>coord_trans()</code>
function transforms the coordinates of the plot. Alternatively, the
<code>scale_x_log10()</code> and <code>scale_y_log10()</code> functions
perform a log (base-10) transformation of each axis. Note the
differences in the appearance of the axes.</p>
<p>Let’s practice using both methods to transform our previous
scatterplot by taking the log (base-10) of both the body weight
(<code>body_wt</code>) and brain weight (<code>brain_wt</code>)
variables.</p>
<p>Fist, let’s use the <code>coord_trans()</code> function to modify our
original scatterplot, so that both the x- and y-axis is on a
<code>"log10"</code> scale.</p>

<div id="section-outliers" class="section level2">
<h2>Outliers</h2>
<p>Observations that don’t seem to fit with the rest of points may be
considered “outliers.” There isn’t a universal, hard-and-fast definition
of what constitutes an “outlier,” but they are often easy to spot in a
scatterplot.</p>
<p>Outliers deserve attention because they might: 1. <strong>Represent
errors</strong> (data entry mistakes, measurement problems) 2.
<strong>Be exceptional cases</strong> (genuine but unusual
observations)</p>
<p><strong>What to do</strong>: Always investigate outliers, but don’t
automatically remove them!</p>
<p>In this scatterplot, we consider the relationship between the number
of home runs hit by Major League baseball players in 2010 and the number
of bases they stole. Home runs are a measure of batting power, while
stolen bases are a measure of footspeed. It is not surprising that we
see a negative relationship here, since power and speed are generally
complementary skills.</p>
<p><img src="ims-two-variables_files/figure-html/homerun-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Since both variables here are integer-valued, several of the
observations have the same coordinates, and thus the corresponding
points are plotted on top of one another. This can misrepresent the
data!</p>
<div id="section-add-transparency" class="section level3">
<h3>Add transparency</h3>
<p>To combat this, we can add transparency to the points, using the
<code>alpha</code> argument. This allows for us to see that the
overplotting occurs where the darker dots are.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = mlbbat10, aes(x = stolen_base, y = home_run)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)</code></pre>

<h3>Identifying outliers</h3>
<p>In this plot, there are two points that stand out as potential
outliers: the one in the lower-right hand corner, and the one at the
very top. We will discuss later in the course how to handle these
outliers, but for now, it is enough to simply identify them and
investigate them. In this case, we can use the <code>filter()</code>
function to identify those players with <strong>at least</strong> 60
stolen bases or <strong>at least</strong> 50 home runs. As it turns out,
the player in the lower-right hand corner is Juan Pierre, who is one of
the speediest and least powerful hitters in recent memory. The player at
the top is Jose Bautista, one of the game’s most revered sluggers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mlbbat10 |&gt;

<div id="section-your-turn-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Your turn!</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve seen several examples, it’s time to practice creating
and interpreting scatterplots yourself. Remember: - Put the response
variable on the y-axis - Put the explanatory variable on the x-axis -
Look for form, direction, strength, and outliers</p>
<p>In later units (Chapter 5 of the IMS textbook), we will discuss how
outliers can affect the results of a linear regression model and how we
can deal with them. For now, it is enough to simply identify them and
note how the relationship between two variables may change as a result
of removing outliers.</p>
<div id="section-real-world-application-baseball-statistics"
class="section level3">
<h3>Real-World Application: Baseball Statistics</h3>
<p>In baseball, small sample sizes can be misleading. A player who goes
2-for-2 has a perfect 1.000 batting average, but we wouldn’t expect that
to continue!</p>
<p>This is why we filter for players with at least 200 at-bats—we want
reliable rate statistics based on sufficient opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Your task</strong>: Clean the data and create a clearer
scatterplot.</p>
<p>Recall that in the baseball example earlier in the lesson, most of
the points were clustered in the lower left corner of the plot, making
it difficult to see the general pattern of the majority of the data.
This difficulty was caused by a few outlying players whose on-base
percentages (OBPs) were exceptionally high. These values are present in
our dataset only because these players had very few batting
opportunities.</p>
<p>Both OBP and SLG are known as <em>rate</em> statistics, since they
measure the frequency of certain events over time (as opposed to their
<em>count</em>). In order to compare these rates sensibly, it makes
sense to include only players with a reasonable number of opportunities,
so that these observed rates have the chance to approach what we might
expect from a player’s long-run rate.</p>
<p>In Major League Baseball, batters qualify for the batting title only
if they have 3.1 plate appearances per game. This translates into
roughly 502 plate appearances in a 162-game season. The
<code>mlbbat10</code> dataset does not include plate appearances as a
variable, but we can use at-bats (<code>at_bat</code>)–which constitute
a subset of plate appearances–as a proxy.</p>
<p>Let’s make a scatterplot of the same relationship as before, but only
for players with at least 200 at-bats. To do this, we’ll need to carry
out the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a new dataset named <code>ab_gt_200</code> which contains
only the players who had at least 200 at-bats.</li>
<li>Using <code>ab_gt_200</code>, create a scatterplot for
<code>slg</code> as a function of <code>obp</code>.</li>
